### Lab Duration: 20 minutes

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to give students a basic introduction to administering an OpenStack cloud. Although you install each OpenStack service separately, the OpenStack services work together to meet your cloud needs: Identity, Compute, Image service, Block Storage, Networking (neutron), Object Storage, Orchestration, and Telemetry. These services may be distributed or local to one another, but in all instances, after you have authenticated yourself through Identity (keystone), you use OpenStack APIs to create and admin OpenStack cloud resources.

#### 1. Servers and Nova Services

Using some basic CLI tools can help give you a sense of the shape of your OpenStack cloud; number of servers, the health of each server (Up / Down), and what services are running where.

1. SSH to your controller, log in as ender (this was covered in lab 00), and then issue the following command. This changes your prompt and gives you OpenStack command authority.

    `[ender@controller]#` `source admin.rc`

    ```
    ender@controller admin > 
    ```

2. The command you issued above set *environmental variables" Check them out as follows:
 
    `ender@controller admin >` `printenv | grep OS_`

    ```
    OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=default
    OS_IMAGE_API_VERSION=2
    OS_PROJECT_NAME=admin
    OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3
    OS_PASSWORD=alta3
    OS_AUTH_URL=http://controller:35357/v3
    OS_USERNAME=admin
    OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME=default
    ```

    > More detail on setting environmental variables will be explained in labs coming up, for right now, just know it has to do with setting proper permissions within the bash shell; a shortcut that tells the OpenStack cloud that we are the user admin. Your CLI prompt will also change.


3. List the current services

   `ender@controller admin >` `openstack service list --long`

    ```
    +----------------------------------+----------+----------------+-------------------------+---------+
    | ID                               | Name     | Type           | Description             | Enabled |
    +----------------------------------+----------+----------------+-------------------------+---------+
    | 342a91e8d7b24851b75971ab510c78cb | heat-cfn | cloudformation | Orchestration           | True    |
    | 3a8fff978224491b86920b31cc456624 | neutron  | network        | OpenStack Networking    | True    |
    | 762b8b0433bd436a998507b548856482 | cinder   | volume         | OpenStack Block Storage | True    |
    | a5e3542f32ad4b3fa5c20a5391ef125a | cinderv2 | volumev2       | OpenStack Block Storage | True    |
    | d8693804ab66421ea59a79c3198bf855 | glance   | image          | OpenStack Image         | True    |
    | d92e73b2d66d48c994756a230554cea9 | nova     | compute        | OpenStack Compute       | True    |
    | dda2f4186d1a4f3cb2be52a20ac70c71 | heat     | orchestration  | Orchestration           | True    |
    | e5349a024bdc4ce99e194b218ee32430 | keystone | identity       | OpenStack Identity      | True    |
    +----------------------------------+----------+----------------+-------------------------+---------+
```
  - *Question:* Is the ID globally unique value?
    - Answer: YES!
  - *Question:* Is the Name Unique?
    - *Answer:* NO! If you want to refer to a specific item *ALWAYS* use the ID, the same Name may refer to many items
    - *Question:* You mean two different ITEMS may have the same name???
      - *Answer:* YES!
        - *Question:* So how do I tell them apart?
        - *Answer:* Refer to items by the *ID* and try not to give things the SAME NAME to different items just because OpenStack will allow you to do that
  - *Question:* Do the IDs above match the IDs you see on your screen?
    - *Answer:* No, IDs are *globally unique across all space and time* 
  - *Question:* When doing a lab, and an example allows you to cut an paste an ID, will that work?
    - Answer: Nope! IDs are globally unique. When they appear in the labs, they are there **AS AN EXAMPLE**.   
  - Question: Are all your services enabled?
    - Answer: Yes, they should all be enabled.

3. Make sure nova compute is running.  

   `ender@controller admin >` `openstack compute service list`

    ```
	+----+------------------+------------+----------+---------+-------+----------------------------+
	| Id | Binary           | Host       | Zone     | Status  | State | Updated At                 |
	+----+------------------+------------+----------+---------+-------+----------------------------+
	|  1 | nova-conductor   | controller | internal | enabled | up    | 2016-08-19T14:30:02.000000 |
	|  9 | nova-consoleauth | controller | internal | enabled | up    | 2016-08-19T14:30:03.000000 |
	| 10 | nova-scheduler   | controller | internal | enabled | up    | 2016-08-19T14:30:03.000000 |
	| 11 | nova-compute     | compute1   | nova     | enabled | up    | 2016-08-19T14:30:02.000000 |
	+----+------------------+------------+----------+---------+-------+----------------------------+
	```  
    - **Q1: How many compute servers are running?**
      - A1: In the above example, just one, called nova-compute. Your experience may be different!
    - **Q2: Are the services running?**
      - A2: Yes, the state indicates "up" 
    - **Q3 How many OpenStack cloud controllers are running?**
      - A3: According to the **Host** column, One cloud controller (controller) is running
    - **Q4 What does "zone" mean.**
      - A4: Within a Region (RegionOne for us), compute nodes can be logically grouped into "zones", or more corectly said; "Availability Zones*, which can be specified when lanuching an instance. For instance, the "internal" zone is software running on the controller itself. We do NOT want to run an instance on the controller, rather, we want instances running on the "nova" availability zone. Notice that there is only one host that is part of the nova availability zone. 
      - A really nice explaination of availability zones and host aggrgates is here: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/nova/aggregates.html

 ### II. Checking OpenStack Version

4. Return to your home directory, and then source the `keystonerc_admin` file. We will discuss what this file does in subsequent lessons. For right now, understand that it is a way to set what user is interacting with OpenStack at the CLI.

    `ender@controller admin >` `openstack --version`
	
    ```
    openstack 2.3.0
    ```

5. Display the service catalog for the OpenStack admin. Type your down arrow to scroll down. Type `:q` when you want to quit.  

    `ender@controller admin >` `openstack catalog list | less`

	```

  Answer the following questions:

    - **Q1: Does each service name have a public, admin, and internal endpoint?  
      - A1: Yes  
    - **Q2: Why those three?**  
      - A2: Each one exposes a subset of the service api, with admin generally being the most powerful.  
    - **Q3: But some URLs are IDENTICAL between admin, public, or internal?**  
      - A3: Yep!  In that case the same api services are available to each, so there is no difference there.  
    - **Q4: What are the names of the services currently in operation?**  
      - A4: You could count, but just run this command instead: `ender@controller admin >` `openstack service list`  
           ```

6. List the nova service endpoints, does this output look familiar? 

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `nova service-list`

7. Collect the various version releases of your OpenStack services by issuing the following commands. What will be displayed is the version release of each service.

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `keystone-manage --version`

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `nova-manage --version`

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `glance-manage --version`

8. That version doesn't mean much until you click on the link and use the chart to correlate the release version to the name of an actual OpenStack release. Navigate in browser to: [OpenStack Releases](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Releases)

9. Look over the chart and notice that the version of Kilo is the same version that was being displayed each time you issued the `[$SERVICE]-manage --version` command.

 * OpenStack is a project with ambitious release dates. Take a minute to read over the notes concerning how the project is maintained.
 
That's it for this lab!
