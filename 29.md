### THURSDAY- &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective 

The objective of this lab is to create a block storage volume with Cinder and then attach it to a VM instance. This is the virtual equivalent of plugging a new drive into a computer. Just like a physical drive, volumes can be attached, detached, reattached, and moved between VM instances.

### Procedure

0. Take a moment to clean up any clutter on your remote desktop. At this time, you only need a Firefox browser open on your remote desktop session.

0. Log into Horizon as **`default:chestercopperpot:fa5tpa55w0rd`**

0. Navigate to **Project > Compute > Volumes**

0. Click on the button **+Create Volume**. See the screenshot below if you have any problems.

0. Fill out the pop-up window as follows:

    ```
    Name: cargo-bay
    Description: new volume for vt2
    Volume Source: No source, empty volume
    Type: No volume type
    Size (GB): 1
    Availability Zone: nova
    ```
	
0. Click the blue **Create Volume** button. After you do, your screen should look like the screenshot below.

0. Let's attach this volume to our VM instance (vt2)

0. Under **Actions** click the drop down menu, and then select **Manage Attachments**. See the screenshot below if you are lost.

0. In the pop-up window, select (vt2) from the drop down menu

0. Click the **Attach Volume** button

    >
    The volume will now be attached and mounted by our instance (vt2). It will take 10 or so seconds to attach.
	
0. Answer the following questions:
    - **Q1: Is the volume being actively used by the instance (is it in-use)?**
      - A1: Yes, the status is shown as In-use.
    - **Q2: Where is the volume attached on vt2?**
      - Q2: It is attached to vt2 on /dev/vdb
    - **Q3: Is this a bootable volume?**
      - Q3: No
    - **Q4: Could you detach this volume, and attach it to a difference instance?**
      - Q4: Yes. Think of this volume as you might a USB thumbdrive. The data travels with the volume.
	
0. Great job! That's it for this lab.
