3. If your default browser is Chrome or firefox, while **holding down the control key**, click: https://alta3.com/sshproxy to connect to your SSH proxy. If your default browser is IE, then cut and paste `https://alta3.com/sshproxy` into a new chrome or firefox browser window.
 
4. Answer the following questions to confirm that you understand the lab environment:
    - **Q1: How many browser tabs will you have open to do these labs?**
      - A1: Three. One for the lab manual (https://alta3.com/labs/openstack), one for terminal access (https://alta3.com/sshproxy), and one for Horion (https://**LAST_NAME**.alta3.training)
    - **Q2: When you are asked to connect via command line, will everyone use the same URL?  If so, what is it?**
      - Q2: Yes. Everyone will use (https://alta3.com/sshproxy) as a 'hop of point' into the CLI of their own controller.
    - **Q3: When you connect to OpenStack Horizon, what URL will you browse? (Hint, find your name on the table above)**
      - Q3: The OpenStack Horizon Dashboard is available via (https://**YOUR_LAST_NAME_HERE**.alta3.training)
    - **Q4: How many nodes are in your OpenStack lab environment?**
      - Q4: Four - Controller, Networking, Compute1, and Compute2
    - **Q5: Where will VMs run?**
      - Q5: VMs will always run on compute nodes, never on the Controller or Networking nodes.
