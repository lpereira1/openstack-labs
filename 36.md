### HOMEWORK - &#x1F680;OPTIONAL&#x1F680;

### Lab Objective
The objective of this lab is to teach students how to stand-up a single-node deployment of OpenStack. You might use an old laptop, AWS, Google Cloud, or use a VMWare or Oracle Virtual Box to run it as a VM. The only prerequisite, is that you have a new install of CentOS 7.

This lab is only for the most advanced students interested in building their own environment for testing and research.

#### Instructions for running OpenStack on CentOS 7 in a Virtual Environment

0. These steps were **Tested with [VMWare vSphere ESXi VM](https://www.vmware.com)**

  - These same steps should work on Oracle Virtual Box

0. The platform virtualized for installing OpenStack with Packstack, was a single VM with 8 gigs RAM, 1 NIC, 1 core, and a 60 gig drive

0. After the VM was created, it was told to boot from the CentOS 7 'everything' ISO

  - A mirror list with the CentOS 7 ISO is available [here](http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-Everything-1611.iso)

0. Select **Install CentOS Linux 7**

0. An installation GUI will appear, make the following changes:

  - Software Selection: **GNOME Desktop**
  
  - Network & Hostname: **Ethernet - Set to ON** <- should not say 'disconnected'
  
  - Network & Hostname: **Hostname: packstack** <- or anything you wish

0. Click "Begin Installation"

  - Set a Root Password: **openstacker01**

  - Create User: **centstack** <- check box to make this user an admin
  
  - Password: **openstacker**
  
0. After CentOS 7 is done installing, it will reboot.

0. Accept the license agreement, then click **Finish Configuration**.

0. Log in to CentOS 7 as the user **centstack** and the password **openstacker**

0. Open a terminal window **Applications > Terminal**

0. **IMPORTANT** At the CLI, it is typical to get a warning that the Yum package installer is locked, and as a result, all Yum commands will fail. The fix is to issue the following command to kill the process (PackageKit) holding the lock on Yum:

    `[censtack@packstack ~]$` `sudo pkill packagekit`
  
      - If you are prompted for password, enter the password **openstacker** (the password for the user centstack)

0. Run the following commands to install OpenStack via the PackStack installer.

    `[censtack@packstack ~]$` `sudo yum install -y centos-release-openstack-ocata`
     
0. Update Yum.

  `[censtack@packstack ~]$` `sudo yum update -y`

0. Install PackStack from Yum.

  `[censtack@packstack ~]$` `sudo yum install -y openstack-packstack`

0. Install OpenStack 'all-in-one' deployment with the PackStack installer. 

  `[censtack@packstack ~]$` `sudo packstack --allinone`
   
0. This process will take about 45 minutes. The longest step is the last one, which reads 'Verifying Puppet...'. This alone takes a half hour.

0. When the process completes, the **admin** user will have an OpenRC file auto-generated in the root home directory (/root). The file is titled **keystonerc_admin**. Cat this file to find the admin password.

  `[censtack@packstack ~]$` `sudo cat /root/keystonerc_admin'
  
    - Enter the password **openstacker** if prompted
     
0. Note the password, and the IP address displayed in this file.

0. Open Firefox via **Applications > Firefox Web Browser**

0. Navigate to the IP address displayed in the RC file (do not include the port, just the IP)

0. Sign into horizon using the admin UN, and the password from the RC file.

0. Congradulations! You're off and OpenStacking on your own!
