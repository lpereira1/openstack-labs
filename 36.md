### HOMEWORK - &#x1F680;OPTIONAL&#x1F680;

### Lab Objective
The objective of this lab is to teach students how to stand-up a single-node deployment of OpenStack. You might use an old laptop, AWS, Google Cloud, or use a VMWare or Oracle Virtual Box to run it as a VM. The only prerequisite, is that you have a new install of CentOS 7.

This lab is only for the most advanced students interested in building their own environment for testing and research.

#### 0. Instructions for running OpenStack in a Virtual Environment

**Tested with [VMWare vSphere ESXi VM](https://www.vmware.com)**

* Deployed on a single ESXi VM with access to 6 gigs RAM, 1 NIC, 2 cores, and a 60 gig drive

A mirror list with the CentOS 7 ISO is available [here](http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-Everything-1611.iso)

0. Install the CentOS7 operating system, making the following selections:

  - Software Selection: **GNOME Desktop**
  
  - Network & Hostname: **Ethernet - Set to ON**
  
  - Network & Hostname: **Hostname: packstack** <- or anything you wish
  
  - Create User: **centstack**
  
  - Password: **openstacker**
  
0. After CentOS7 is done installing, log in as the user **centstack** and the password **openstacker**

0. Open a terminal window **Applications > Terminal**

0. Run the following commands to install OpenStack via the PackStack installer.

	 `[censtack@packstack ~]$` `sudo yum install -y centos-release-openstack-ocata`

0. **IMPORTANT** If you get a warning that the Yum package installer is locked, then the command failed. The fix is to issue the following command to kill the processes, then reissue your failed command:
	 
	 `[censtack@packstack ~]$` `sudo pkill ****`
   
     - Enter the password **openstacker** if prompted
     
0. Update Yum.

	 `[censtack@packstack ~]$` `sudo yum update -y`

0. Install PackStack from Yum.

	 `[censtack@packstack ~]$` `sudo yum install -y openstack-packstack`

0. Install OpenStack 'all-in-one' deployment with the PackStack installer. 

	 `[censtack@packstack ~]$` `sudo packstack --allinone`
   
0. This process will take about 45 minutes. The longest step is the last one, which reads 'Verifying Puppet...'. This alone takes a half hour.

0. When the process completes, the **admin** user will have an OpenRC file auto-generated in the root home directory (/root). The file is titled **keystonerc_admin**. Cat this file to find the admin password.

	 `[censtack@packstack ~]$` `sudo cat /root/keystonerc_admin'
   
     - Enter the password **openstacker** if prompted
     
0. Note the password, and the IP address displayed in this file.

0. Open Firefox via **Applications > Firefox Web Browser**

0. Navigate to the IP address displayed in the RC file (do not include the port, just the IP)

0. Sign into horizon using the admin UN, and the password from the RC file.

0. Congradulations! You're off and OpenStacking on your own!
