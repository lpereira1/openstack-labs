### TUESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to learn to how to launch instances from the CLI. This is a critical lab to understand, so don't hesitate to repeat it.

### Procedure

0. SSH to your controller as student.

    `student@beachhead:~#` `ssh controller`

0. In later labs, we'll launch VMs as our customers. For now, we'll launch a VM in the admin project. Therefore, source the admin.rc file to issue commands as admin.

    `student@controller:~#` `source admin.rc`

0. Let's try launching some instances from the CLI. See what flavors are available for use to admin.

    `student@controller (admin) :~#` `openstack flavor list`
    
0. See what images are available for use. Remeber that the image is the bootable portion. 

    `student@controller (admin) :~#` `openstack image list`
    
0. We want to launch a VM on demo-net, so issue the network list command.

    `student@controller (admin) :~#` `openstack network list`
    
0. Issue that command again, but include the grep command which declares that we only wish to see lines that contain the word "demo-net".

    `student@controller (admin) :~#` `openstack network list | grep demo-net`

    ```
    Copy YOUR UUID value --> | b950cd8d-56ae-48f5-a2b6-c13a280f8dfc | demo-net | 330b9b42-5b8f-4aac-963a-0390f0acabfd |
    ```
    
0. We have not studied networking yet. Normally, we would first create a virtual network, then launch that instance on that private network. We can study that later, for now, copy the UUID that prefaces the word demo-net (it was revealed in the last step with the **openstack image list** command). There is an arrow pointing to the UUID you need.
 
0. **IMPORTANT**: This step requires customization. Boot an instance called vt1 with the flavor custom.shrimpy, from the image cirros, and place it on the demo-net network (more on networking is coming up).

    `student@controller (admin) :~#` `openstack server create --flavor custom.shrimpy --image cirros --nic net-id=<UUID_OF_demo-net> vt1`
 
    > where `<UUID_OF_demo-net>` = the UUID of demo-net that you cut and paste from the above command `openstack network list`

    ```
 
0. Display a list of the running instances within the current tenant

    `student@controller (admin) :~#` `openstack server list`
    
0. Display information only about the running instance vt1 that was just created:

    `student@controller (admin) :~#` `openstack server show vt1`

0. Log into the Horizon dashboard interface as **`default:admin:alta3`**

0. Navigate to **Project > Compute > Instances**

0. Click on the instance name (vt1). See the screen shot below if you're lost.

	![Navigate to VM](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_horizon_click_vm.png)

0. Click on the log tab. Spend some time examining the log.

	![Navigate to VM](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_horizon_click_vm_log.png)

0. Click on the console tab. Try putting the VM in full screen mode by clicking the, "Click here to show only console" link. If you see an all black screen, you might need to hit the /<ENTER/> key a few times to wake up the VM, but you should be able to log in to the Cirros VM with the following credentials **cirros:cubswin:)** Check out the screenshot below if you are lost.

0. If you took Horizon into fullscreen mode, hit the back button on your Firefox brower (the one in your remote desktop, not the browser on your local system).

0. That's it for this lab! We'll continue to explore manipulating instances, but feel free to exploring launching instances from the CLI or Horizon, or checking out other OpenStack commands.
