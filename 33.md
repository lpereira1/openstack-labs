### HOMEWORK - &#x1F680;OPTIONAL&#x1F680;

### Lab Objective

This is a practice exam is for those students that have completed all the labs early, or those looking to test their skills after class. Each step is a new objective which lacks the associated procedure. That's where your admin skills come in. If you find yourself stumbling on a perticular task, look back to previous labs to see how to complete the task.

Good luck!
