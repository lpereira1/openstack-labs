### HOMEWORK - &#x1F680;OPTIONAL&#x1F680;

### Lab Objective

This is a practice exam is for those students that have completed all the labs early, or those looking to test their skills after class. Each step is a new objective which lacks the associated procedure. That's where your admin skills come in. If you find yourself stumbling on a perticular task, look back to previous labs to see how to complete the task.

**If you plan to pass the OCA Exam, you should be able to do all of the following tasks (from memory) at the CLI. Remember, not all tasks may be completed with Horizon!**

Good luck!

### Procedure

0. Launch 2 VMs on the new network with the flavor m1.tiny. Give both floating IPs. Make sure both of these VMs have 2-way connectivity on port 5060 and port 22.

0. Use the CLI to create \*.rc files for your new users.
