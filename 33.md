### THURSDAY - &#x1F680;OPTIONAL&#x1F680;

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to deploy the python-clients that allow users to interact with API endpoints from the CLI. There are many "one-off" clients that target a single OpenStack project's APIs, however one OpenStack python-client seeks to 'rule them all'. This unifying client is known as the python-openstackclient.

We'll be installing the client on a Linux system, however, the following link demonstrates the installation process on other computing platforms (Windows, Mac OS, and various Linux distros). In addition, it explains how to install other "one-off" python-clients: https://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/common/cli-install-openstack-command-line-clients.html

### Procedure

0. From your remote desktop, open a terminal session, and move to the student home directory.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd`

0. You **DO NOT** need to run the following command. This is a prerequisite step that install python, so it is included, but python has already been installed (it typically is installed with Linux distros). If you do run it, you'll be prompted for a password; use **CTRL + C** to escape.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo apt install python-dev python-pip`

0. You **DO NOT** need to run the following command. This is the step that installs the python-openstackclient. However, this has already been done for you. If you do run it, you'll be prompted for a password; use **CTRL + C** to escape.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `pip install python-openstackclient`
    
0. That was easy! Test to see that the client is properly installed.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `openstack`

0. If it worked, your environment should have changed to **(openstack)**. Exit the environment.

    `(openstack)` `exit`
    
0. Before we can issue any commands, we need to replicate an RC file here on host beachhead. Let's use vim to create an **admin.rc**

    `student@beachhead:~$` `vim admin.rc`

0. Press the **i** key to enter --INSERT-- mode.

0. Copy and paste the following into admin.rc.
    
    ```
    export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME=default
    export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=default
    export OS_PROJECT_NAME=admin
    export OS_USERNAME=admin
    export OS_PASSWORD=alta3
    export OS_AUTH_URL=http://controller:35357/v3
    export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3
    export OS_IMAGE_API_VERSION=2
    export PS1="\[\e[33m\]\u\[\e[m\]@\[\e[36m\]\h\[\e[m\] (\[\e[35m\]admin\[\e[m\]) :\W\$ "
    ```

0. Press **ESC** to exit --INSERT-- mode.

0. Type **:wq** then press *Enter* to writeout and quit.

0. Source the new admin.rc file.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `source admin.rc`
    
0. Now try executing a command to the controller.

    `student@beachhead (admin) :~$` `openstack image list`
    
0. If it works, you'll be returned a list of available images! Good job! Feel free to remotely execute some other OpenStack commands. Note, you're making changes to your OpenStack cloud without being on the controller! Cool!
