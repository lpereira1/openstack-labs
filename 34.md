# Lab 34 - Wireshark

### THURSDAY - &#x2B50;OPTIONAL&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to further your understanding of HTTP transactions issued between the python-openstackclient, and various OpenStack API endpoints.

### Procedure
 
0. Like every lab, take a moment and clean up your remote desktop screen. Close any old terminal windows you have open.

0. Now click on the the Wireshark icon in the lower left-hand corner of the screen. The icon you are looking for is blue, and depicts a sharkfin.

0. Once Wireshark is open, double click on the click on the **any** interface. This will ask Wireshark to capture on all physical interfaces.

0. Wireshark will begin capturing packets, however, we *only* want to display those message that are type HTTP. Type **http** (lowercase) in the bar at the top of Wireshark that currently reads, "Apply a display filter..."

0. Press enter after you type **http** to apply the display filter. This should Wireshark to display no packets, as you should not yet have captured any HTTP traffic.

0. Now open a terminal session. The python-openstackclient has already been installed on the local remote desktop, so we just need to recreate an OpenRC file here. First change to the home directory.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd`

0. Now create a local copy of admin.rc with vim.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `vim admin.rc`

0. Press the **i** key to enter insert mode.

0. Copy and paste the following into vim.

    ```
   export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME=default
   export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=default
   export OS_PROJECT_NAME=admin
   export OS_USERNAME=admin
   export OS_PASSWORD=alta3
   export OS_AUTH_URL=http://controller:35357/v3
   export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3
   export OS_IMAGE_API_VERSION=2
   export PS1="\[\e[33m\]\u\[\e[m\]@\[\e[36m\]\h\[\e[m\] (\[\e[35m\]admin\[\e[m\]) :\W\$ "
    ```
   
0. Press the **esc** key to exit insert mode in vim.

0. Press **Shift** and the **:** key to issue a command.

0. Type **wq** to writeout and quit.

0. Now source the new admin.rc file.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `source admin.rc`
    
0. Issue an OpenStack command.

    `student@beachhead (admin) :~$` `openstack flavor list`

0. Great, you should have a flavor list returned to you. However, click back to Wireshark.

0. At the top of the screen, press the big red square to stop capturing packets.

0. Click around within Wirehshark to explore the captured HTTP messages between your openstack-pythonclient, and the OpenStack APIs.
