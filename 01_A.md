### Lab Duration: 10 minutes

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to give students an introduction to administering an OpenStack cloud at the CLI with the Openstack python-clients. OpenStack APIs are serviced by HTTP(S) messages, which are tedious and burdosome for a human to write. The purpose of all of the python-clients is to translate simple CLI commands into complex HTTP(S) messages, as well as 'cherry pick' content out of the HTTP(S) responses, and print them to the screen.

#### Using the python-openstackclient

0. Launch the **python-openstackclient**

    >OpenStack is attempting to 'unite' all of the OpenStack commands inside of a common python 'wrapper', or a platform that allows you to issue a common set of commands for every OpenStack service. This is why CLI commands issued to the keystone-pythonclient are receiving deprecation warnings. Some people are using the openstack-pythonclient, and some are not, but we think it is important you know it exists.

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `openstack`
	
0. Display the **python-openstackclient** commands
    
    `(openstack)` `help`

0. Exit the **python-openstackclient**
	
    `(openstack)` `exit`

    >The permissions still apply! If you have sourced the `keystonerc_admin` file, then launch the **python-openstackclient**, then you are issuing commands to OpenStack as admin.	

0. Check out all of the Openstack python-clients available, and currently in development https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OpenStackClients
