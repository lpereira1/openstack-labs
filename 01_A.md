## Lab XY - Openstack python-clients - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### MONDAY

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to give students an introduction to administering an OpenStack cloud at the CLI with the Openstack python-clients. OpenStack APIs are serviced by HTTP(S) messages, which are tedious and burdosome for a human to write. The purpose of all of the python-clients is to translate simple CLI commands into complex HTTP(S) messages, as well as 'cherry pick' content out of the HTTP(S) responses, and print them to the screen.

### Procedure

0. Check out all of the Openstack python-clients available, and currently in development: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OpenStackClients

  > At one time, every service at the CLI was accessed using a dedicated python-client. This was chaotic as no two python-clients worked EXACTLY the same way.  OpenStack is attempting to 'unite' all of the OpenStack commands inside of a common python 'wrapper', or a platform that allows you to issue a common set of commands for every OpenStack service. 

0. Launch the **python-openstackclient** environment

    `root@controller:~$` `openstack`
	
0. Display the **python-openstackclient** commands
    
    `(openstack)` `help`

0. Exit the **python-openstackclient**
	
    `(openstack)` `exit`

0. Use the less command to review all of the commands associated with the **python-openstackclient**
	
    `root@controller:~$` `openstack help | less`
	
    > Have you used *less* before?  If not, may be hopelessly stuck right now!  Read the following:  
    *Quit:* Press `q` to quit less  
    Scroll down: Press the down arrow (you start out at the top of the service catalog)  
    Scroll up: Press the up arrow to scroll back up  
    Foward one window: CTRL + F  
    Back one window: CTRL + B

0. Commands can be issued from within the **(openstack)** environment, or by typing **openstack** before every command.
