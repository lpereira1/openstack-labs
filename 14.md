### TUESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to create and work with domains. Domains are highly flexible concepts, but in all cases they are areas of administrative control. Each domain can have its own administrator, which controls users, projects, and resources within their domain.

   - **Order 3:** The Shire Inc. would like to have their CTO, Gandalf the Grey, to be the admin of their own domain. They plan to have lots of projects, and would like their own administrator to control the resources assigned to those projects.

### Procedure

0. We don't need any old terminal windows open, so close them all, and then open a new one. Once you have a new terminal window open, SSH to controller. 

    `student@beachhead:/$` `ssh controller`

0. The CLI prompt should now read as follows:

    `student@controller:~$`

0. Issue the following command to allow you to issue commands to OpenStack as admin.

    `student@controller:~$` `source admin.rc`

0. Create a new domain called **the_shire**
	
    `student@controller (admin) :~$`  `openstack domain create the_shire`

0. Create the first project space, called **bag_end**, inside of the project **the_shire**

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack project create --domain the_shire bag_end`
   
0. Create the user **gandalf** with the password **noneshallpass** within the **default** domain.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack user create --project bag_end --password noneshallpass --email gandalf@theshire.example --domain the_shire gandalf`

0. Define a role for the user **gandalf**

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack role add --domain the_shire --user gandalf admin`

0. Confirm that creation of the Gandalf user was successful by logging into the Horizon interface (http://controller/horizon) as **the_shire:gandalf:noneshallpass**

0. Navigate to **Identity > Projects**

0. Answer the following questions:

    - **Q1: Can gandalf see acme_inc or vault_tek projects?**
      - A1: No, gandalf can only see bag_end. The acme_inc and vault_tek projects are in the default domain.
    - **Q2: Can gandalf launch VMs right now?**
      - A2: No, gandalf is an admin within this new domain, but this domain has not been authorized to consume resources. We'd need to make some other tweaks to Keystone, Service Catalog, & OpenStack permissions if we'd actually want to use this new domain. This exercise is simply a proof-of-concept. Domains can be set up, and administered seperately 	

0. Sign out of Horizon.

0. Sign into Horizon as **:default:admin:alta3:**

0. Click on **Identity > Projects**

0. Answer the following question:

    - **Q1: Can admin see the bag_end project?**
      - A1: No, admin cannot see bag_end. The bag_end project is in the domain the_shire.
      
0. Good Job! That is it for this lab.
