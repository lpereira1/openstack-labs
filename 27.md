## Lab 27 - Glance - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### THURSDAY

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to offer some exposure to using the Glance (Image) service. In this lab, a CirrOS image has already been downloaded and named. We will launch an instance with it. 
 
We keep talking about CirrOS. If it hasn't been explained already, CirrOS is a minimal (CirrOS < 15Mb) Linux distro that was designed for testing cloud instances (such as those on an OpenStack compute node). Take a minute, and check out all of the CirrOS downloads available by navigating to: http://download.cirros-cloud.net/.

Be aware that if your deployment is using QEMU or KVM, OpenStack recommends that you use images using the qcow2 format. The most recent 64-bit qcow2 image is available at http://download.cirros-cloud.net/0.3.4/cirros-0.3.4-x86_64-disk.img

### Procedure

0. SSH to your controller and log in as root (you might use PuTTy for this)

0. Once logged into the controller, issue the following command:

	`ender@controller admin >` `source admin.rc`

0. Retrieve a list of openstack commands relating to the Glance image service 

	`ender@controller admin >` `openstack help | grep image`

0. Ask glance to retrieve the image list

	`ender@controller admin >` `openstack image list`

0. Download the cirros operating system

	`ender@controller admin >` `wget https://download.cirros-cloud.net/0.3.4/cirros-0.3.4-x86_64-disk.img --no-check-certificate`

0. Create a new image with cirros-0.3.4-x86_64-disk.img with the name cirros_alph
	
	`ender@controller admin >` `openstack image create --disk-format qcow2 --container-format bare --public --file cirros-0.3.4-x86_64-disk.img cirros_alpha`
  
0. Once again retrieve an image list and see the newly added image

	`ender@controller admin >` `openstack image list`

0. Launch an instance from the command line with the new instance cirros_alpha:

	`ender@controller admin >` `neutron net-list`
	
	* Highlight the id of the fabric network 
	
	`ender@controller admin >` `openstack server create --flavor custom.shrimpy --image cirros_alpha --nic net-id=<fabric_network_id> admin_box`
	
0. Log into the Horizon dashboard as `default:admin:alta3`

0. Navigate to **Project > Compute > Instances**

0. Confirm that the VM instance **admin_box** is running
 
0. That's it for this lab! Feel free to check out the Additional Learning / References listed below
