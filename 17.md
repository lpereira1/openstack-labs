### TUESDAY - &#x1F528;OPTIONAL&#x1F528;

### Lab Objective

This lab is optional, but recommended for all new commers to Linux or the CLI. In OpenStack, we learned that we could type out the `--os-tenant-name`, `--os-user-name`, `--os-password`, and `--os-auth-url` along with every command, or we could set these values so they persist. If you are not a master of the CLI, you might be curious about how this worked! Understanding how it works might also help you in troubleshooting. After all, what if you ran a source file (set environmental variables), and wish you could un-run that source file (unset environmental variables). 

Variables can be of two basic types: shell variables, or environmental variables. Shell variables are only available within the current session, whereas environmental variables are available to the current session, as well as any spawned sessions. What is a session? You're in one right now. The Bash shell that you are sitting at is a 'session'. If you were to type `bash`, you'd launch another session that would be considered a 'child' session, where your current session would be the 'parent'.

If a child session is spawned by a parent session, environmental variables will be made available to the child sessions, whereas a shell variable will not. To better understand the difference, perform this quick procedure; define a shell variable, and then an environmental variable within parent and child bash shells.

### Procedure

0. We don't need any old terminal windows open, so close them all, and then open a new one. No need to SSH to controller for this one. The CLI prompt should now read as follows:

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd`

0. Create a shell variable within the current session. Convention says it should be all caps. Because the string we've defined includes a bang, we are using single quotes to surround 'Hello OpenStack!'.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `LEARNING_VAR='Hello OpenStack!'`
	
0. Great! We can confirm that this is a shell variable that will not be passed down to child processes by grepping within output from set

    `student@beachhead:~$` `set | grep LEARNING_VAR`
	
0. LEARNING_VAR='Hello OpenStack!' should be displayed. Now confirm it is NOT an environmental variable by performing the same procedure with printenv.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `printenv | grep LEARNING_VAR`
	
    > No output should be returned, as printenv will only print environmental variables.

0. Let's take a moment to demonstrate how to access any shell or environmental variable. When the shell encounters a `$` sign, it takes it to mean that it should substitute the value of the variable when it comes across it. Type the following command.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `echo $LEARNING_VAR`

    > The string Hello OpenStack! should be displayed.

0. If you type 'bash', you'll spawn a child shell. Think of this as accessing a 'shell within a shell'.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `bash`

0. Within this child session our variable, `$LEARNING_VAR`, should not be available.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `echo $LEARNING_VAR`

    > No output should be displayed. 
    > Hopefully, why no output was display is clear. This is a child session, and was not passed the previous shell variables. Remember, shell variables are only good for the current shell. Type the following to test this assertion.
	
0. Type exit to close the child session and return to the original session.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `exit`

0. Now that we have exited our child session, the variable `$LEARNING_VAR` should once again be available. 

    `student@beachhead:~$` `echo $LEARNING_VAR`
	
    > Once again, the string Hello OpenStack! should be displayed, as we have returned to the parent shell (the shell we started in).

0. Okay. So to recap, LEARNING_VAR is currently a shell variable, but we can make it an environmental variable by using the export command. Let's also change the value of $LEARNING_VAR from `Hello OpenStack!` to `OpenStack Hello!`.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `export LEARNING_VAR='OpenStack Hello!'`
    
0. Use the command `printenv` to retreive a list of the environmental variables set in this session. You should see that `LEARNING_VAR` now has a value of `OpenStack Hello!`

    `student@beachhead:~$` `printenv | grep LEARNING_VAR`
	
0. Now, let us run the same experiment and observe our minor change. Once again, spawn a child shell.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `bash`
    
0. Okay, now issue the exacty same command before, however, our variable `LEARNING_VAR` was set as an environmental varaible, not a shell variable.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `echo $LEARNING_VAR`
 
    > `OpenStack Hello!` should be displayed. 

0. Within this child session, display the value of all environmental variable.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `printenv | grep LEARNING_VAR`
	
0. Now let's set an environmental variable from within our current child shell.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `export NEW_LEARNING_VAR='Bonjour OpenStack!'`
	
0. Issue the following commands to confirm that it was indeed set as an environmental variable.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `printenv | grep NEW_LEARNING_VAR`

0. Exit the child session, and return to the original parent shell.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `exit`

0. Now see if the environmental variable NEW_LEARNING_VAR is still available.

    `student@controller:~$` `printenv | grep NEW_LEARNING_VAR`
   
    > No output is returned. This is because `NEW_LEARNING_VAR` was an environmental variable set in the child shell. Emphasis on the word 'was', because when we exited our child shell, that environmental variable was destroyed.

0. The original variable, LEARNING_VAR can be changed back into a shell variable (demoted to a shell variable), by using export and the -n flag.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `export -n LEARNING_VAR`

0. Test that it is no longer a global variable, but still a shell variable

    `student@beachhead:~$` `printenv | grep LEARNING_VAR`

    > No output will be shown as LEARNING_VAR is no longer an environmental variable.

0. Use the `echo` command to deterine if `LEARNING_VAR` is indeed a shell variable.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `echo $LEARNING_VAR`

    > OpenStack Hello! should be displayed, as LEARNING_VAR is now a shell variable.

0. Use the `set` command to once again confirm that `LEARNING_VAR` is indeed a shell variable.
    
    `student@beachhead:~$` `set | grep LEARNING_VAR`
    
    > `LEARNING_VAR='OpenStack Hello!'` will be displayed, confirming `LEARNING_VAR` exists as a shell variable.

0. A shell and environmental variable can be completely removed by issuing the unset command.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `unset LEARNING_VAR`
    
0. Test to determine if we have indeed removed the value of `LEARNING_VAR`

    `student@beachhead:~$` `echo $LEARNING_VAR`

    > Nothing will be displayed, as `LEARNING_VAR` has been unset
    
0. Use the `set` command to once again confirm that the value of `LEARNING_VAR` was completely removed.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `set | grep LEARNING_VAR`
	
    > Nothing will be displayed.  

0. Great job! If things are still a bit fuzzy, feel free to ask the instructor for some clarification.
