### Lab Duration: 10 minutes

### Lab Objective

0. Throughout the rest of the course, you'll find our documentation uses the vim text editior, however, you may use either **nano** or **vim**. If you have not used either, Alta3 Research recommends you skip **nano**, and learn to use **vim**.

  > Vim is the editor of choice for many developers and power users. It's a "modal" text editor based on the vi editor written by Bill Joy in the 1970s for a version of UNIX. It inherits the key bindings of vi, but also adds a great deal of functionality and extensibility that are missing from the original vi. 

  > In most text editors, the alphanumeric keys are only used to input those characters unless they're modified by a control key. In vim, the mode that the editor is in determines whether the alphanumeric keys will input those characters or move the cursor through the document. This is what is meant by 'modal'. When you first enter vim, you enter in the command mode.

0. Review the following **vim** commands.

  - **To start editing changes by entering the --INSERT-- mode:**
    - press `i`
  
  - **Top stop editing and return to command mode:**
    - press `ESC`

  - **To save and quit:** 
    - press `SHIFT` + `:`
    - press `wq` (writeout and quit)
    - press `ENTER` to confirm

  - **To quit without saving:**
    - press `SHIFT` + `:`
    - press `q!` (to quit)
    - press `ENTER` to confirm

0. Begin creating a text file within the vim environment.

  - `vim zork.test`

0. You enter vim in command mode. To write text, you'll need to change to --INSERT-- mode. To begin writing text, press:

  - `i`

0. Notice in the bottom left hand corner of the screen, it now says --INSERT--

0. Type a few sentences. Be sure to include some carriage returns, like the following:
 
  > West of House
  > You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door.
  > There is a small mailbox here.

0. Okay, great! Now leave --INSERT-- mode, and return to command mode, by pressing the escape key.

  - `i`
