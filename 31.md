### THURSDAY - &#x1F528;OPTIONAL&#x1F528;

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to give students a basic introduction to git and git pull requests.  Many open source projects rely on git for decentralized collaboration, including OpenStack. Although these skills are not critical to passing the OpenStack Certified Administrator exam, they will enrich your understanding of OpenStack and the open source community.

### Procedure

0. In a new tab, **[Create a Github account](https://github.com/join) or [Login](https://github.com/login)**

    ![Create an account](https://i.imgur.com/uTDaD5s.png)

0. Navigate to the Alta3 OpenStack Glossary project by pasting the following URL into a new tab within your browser.

    `https://github.com/alta3/openstack-labs`      

0. Star the repository

    ![Star this repository](https://i.imgur.com/LLAQVg7.png)

    > Staring is like a bookmark on github.com,  you can view and search your stared repositories at [github.com/stars](github.com/stars)

0. **Fork the lab repository** into your account

0. Open a new terminal window open, and SSH to controller. 

    `student@beachhead:/$` `ssh controller`

0. The CLI prompt should now read as follows:

    `student@controller:~$`

0. Change directory to .ssh

    `student@controller:~$` `cd .ssh`
   
0. edit the config file

    `student@controller:~/.ssh$` `vim config` 
    
    Add the github.com config at the bottom of the file so that it looks like this when you are finsihed:
    
    ```
    Host beachhead
        Hostname 172.16.1.4
        User student
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    Host controller
        Hostname 172.16.1.5
        User student
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa 
    Host compute1
        Hostname 172.16.1.6
        User student
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    Host compute2
        Hostname 172.16.1.7
        User student
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    Host github.com
        Hostname github.com
        User git
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_mygithub
    ```
0. Create a new ssh key for your github account. Just press enter when prompted for a passphrase (you'll be prompted twice):

    `student@controller:~/.ssh$` `ssh-keygen -t rsa -f id_rsa_mygithub`

0. Cat the rsa public key you just created.
   
    `student@controller:~/.ssh$` `cat id_rsa_mygithub.pub`

0. Highlight, right click, and copy the key. They key begins with **rsa-ssh** and ends with **student@controller**. The key is inclusive of both (include them when you highlight and copy the key).

0. Go back to Github.com, in the upper right had corner, click on your profile photo. Select **Settings** from the dropdown menu.

0. Along the left hand side of the screen, click on **SSH and GPG keys**.

0. Click the **New SSH Key** button

0. Give it a title, like *major_key* or whatever you wish. Then paste the key you copied down in the key section.

0. Now click the green **Add SSH Key** button.

0. Great. Now we can identify ourselves to github.com using our private key, instead of a username / password combo.

0. Back to the terminal. Test your work by trying to connect to github.com. You'll need to type 'Yes' to accept the RSA key fingerprint after running this step.

    `student@controller:~/.ssh$` `ssh -T git@github.com`
    
    >
    Hi *YourName*! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

0. If you got the friendly greeting, then it worked! Continue on. If not, figure out when it broke down.

0. Create a directory called myopenstack

    `student@controller:~/.ssh$` `mkdir ~/myopenstack`

0. Change directories to my openstack.

    `student@controller:~/myopenstack$` `cd ~/myopenstack`

0. **IMPORTANT:** The next few steps may produce some permission warnings. You may ignore these.

0. You must set up git with some default settings. These will be auto applied when you create a new version by performing a **git commit**. This command will auto apply your name to new git versions.

    `student@controller:~/myopenstack$` `git config --global user.name "YOUR-GITHUB-NAME"`  <-- CUT AND PASTE WARNING

0. This command will auto apply your email to new git versions. This email address does not need to be the same one you used to create your GitHub account.

    `student@controller:~/myopenstack$` `git config --global user.email "YOUR-EMAIL-ADDRESS"`  <-- CUT AND PASTE WARNING

0. This command will display your default setting config.

    `student@controller:~/myopenstack$` `git config --list`

0. Tell the git application you would like to start version tracking on this directory.

    `student@controller:~/myopenstack$` `git init`

0. Dump your command line history to a file called history.txt

    `student@controller:~/myopenstack$` `history > history.txt`
    
0. Add the file history.txt to the staging area for version tracking.
    
    `student@controller:~/myopenstack$` `git add history.txt`
    
0. This command will show that the file history.txt is in the staging area, and has been prepared for version tracking.

    `student@controller:~/myopenstack$` `git status`
    
0. Create a new version with the **git commit** command. Add a comment about the file you will be tracking.

    `student@controller:~/myopenstack$` `git commit -m 'Contains my CLI history'`

0. From the homepage of your github account, click #1 on **+**, then click #2 the **New Repository** from the dropdown. ***If you are NOT logged in, you will NOT see this option!***
    ![Create New Repository](https://i.imgur.com/t4EBwol.png)

0. On your github account, create your new repository called "myopenstack".
 
    ![Create New Repository](https://i.imgur.com/VbWc0uW.png)

0. At your controller SSH sesssion, link your ~/myopenstack directory to the repository you just created.

    `student@controller:~/myopenstack$` `git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-ACCOUNT-NAME-HERE/myopenstack.git`

0. This command tells git to push the latest commit (called master) to the pointer origin (which has been set as your GitHub account repository).

    `student@controller:~/myopenstack$` `git push -u origin master`

0. Great! Go check your GitHub account, and the myopenstack repo should now contain a file called history.txt, which is every command you issued this week. If your account contains this file, you are done with this lab. If it doesn't, perform the next step.

#### ONLY PERFORM THESE STEPS IF THE LAST STEP FAILED!!

0. **Only if the above step fails**, most likely your github repository is out of sync or the remote target is incorrect. Try to resolve the issue as follows:

0. Let's make sure we have the correct target!, first, unset the value for origin.  

    `student@controller:~$` `git remote rm origin`
    
0. Now reset the value for origin.

    `student@controller:~/myopenstack$` `git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-ACCOUNT-NAME-HERE/myopenstack.git`

0. Pull down new files on the github repo in order to synchonize with the master branch.  

    `student@controller:~$` `git pull origin master`

    > This will sync github with your current directly

0. Try the push again

    `student@controller:~/myopenstack$` `git push -u origin master`
