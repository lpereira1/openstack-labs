## Lab 24_B - Floating IP Addresses - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### WEDNESDAY

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to explore how floating IP addresses work. To do so, we will create an instance on demo-net called, "ping-box".

### Procedure

0. Use Firefox within your remote desktop to log into Horizon (http://controller/horizon) as **:default:admin:alta3:**

0. First we want to create a security group, that allows ICMP and SSH. This can be created just like in the last lab. In case you forgot, we'll walk you through it quickly.

0. Click on **Project > Compute > Access & Security** (along the left).

0. Click on the white **'Create Security Group'** button (top right), then fill out the resulting pop up as follows:

    ```
    ***Name:*** icmp-ssh
    **Description:** Allows pings and SSH
    ```
 
0. Click the blue **Create Security Group** button

0. Now click on the white **Manage rules** button for the new **icmp-ssh** security group you just created.

0. Click on the **+Add Rule** button (top right)

0. Fill out the resulting rule as follows:

    ```
    **Rule:** All ICMP
    **Direction:** Ingress
    **Remote:** CIDR
    **CIDR:** 0.0.0.0/0
    ```

0. Click the blue **Add** button when you finish.

0. Repeat that step again, but this time for SSH. Click on the **+Add Rule** button (top right)

0. Fill out the resulting rule as follows:

    ```
    **Rule:** All ICMP
    **Direction:** Ingress
    **Remote:** CIDR
    **CIDR:** 0.0.0.0/0
    ```

0. Click the blue **Add** button when you finish.

0. Great job! Time to launch the instance. Click on **Project > Compute > Instances**

0. Create the VM as follows. Navigate to **Click on Project > Compute > Instances**

0. In the upper right hand corner, **click the 'Launch Instance' button**.

0. Fill the pop-up outlining the details of the instance as follows:

    >
      **Details Tab**
    >
      Instance Name: ping-box
    >
      Availability Zone: nova
    >
      Count: 1
    >
      **Source**
    >
      Select Boot Source: Image (from drop down menu)
    >
      Create New Volume: No
    >
      Allocated: cirros (selected by pressing the + button)
    >
      **Flavor**
    >
      Allocated: m1.tiny (selected by pressing the + button)
    >
      **Networks**
    >
      Allocated: demo-net (selected by pressing the + button)
    >
      **Network Ports**
    >
      (No changes)
    >
      **Security Groups**
    >
      (No changes)
    >
      **Key Pair**
    >
      (No changes)
    >
      **Configuration**
    >
      (No changes)
    >
      **Metadata**
    >
    (No changes)
    >
    
0. Once complete, **Click 'Launch'**. You screen should now look like the following sreen shot. It is ok if your IP address isn't 192.168.30.4, but it should be in the 192.168.30.0/24 range.
    
    > If the IP is not in that ranage, you didn't launch the VM on demo-net.

    ![How it should look](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_lab_horizon_ping_box_vm.png)

0. Write down the IP address of your **ping-box**, we'll need it later.

0. Click on the name **ping-box**

0. Click on the **console** tab

0. Click on the blue link that says **Click here to show only console**

0. Hit enter a few times to wake up the console (sometimes the screen is all black).

0. Log into the cirros box with the Login of **cirros** and the password of **cubswin:)**
    >
    Note, the password will not appear as you type!
    
0. If the cursor becomes a dollar sign, you're logged in. See the screenshot below if you are lost.

    ![How it should look](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_lab_horizon_cirros_novnc.png)

0. Issue the following command in cirros to attempt to ping beachhead (your remote desktop).

    `$` `ping 172.16.1.4`
    
    >
    This command goes on forever, so you need to press **CTRL **+** C** to stop.

0. Okay, so the ping-box can ping the remote desktop. Try to ping a well known Google public DNS server.

    `$` `ping 8.8.8.8`
    
    >
    This command goes on forever, so you need to press **CTRL **+** C** to stop.

0. So, the ping-box can even hit an IP address out on the public web. COOL!

0. See if you can ping ping-box from the beachhead remote desktop. **Launch a new terminal session**.

0. Don't SSH anywhere. Just type the following into the new terminal session, where you'll customize the IP address with the one you recorded as applied to ping-box in the previous step.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `ping 192.168.30.`\<insert_your_ip_here\>
    >
    This command goes on forever, so you need to press **CTRL **+** C** to stop.
    
0. Close the terminal session to *student@beachhead*, we're done with it for now.

0. Well that didn't work. Let's think about why. Answer the following questions:

    - **Q1: Does the VM have the correct security group applied?**
      - A1: Yes. We made a custom security group called icmp-ssh and allowed ICMP and SSH traffic in to the VM.
    - **Q2: Could it be that the router (demo-router) that is connected to 192.168.30.0/24 is a NAT?**
      - A2: Yes! So what we need is an IP address on a network that isn't behind the NAT if we want anyone outside of this network to be able to talk to us. This is also called a floating IP address.

0. In the Firefox session within the remote desktop, press the back button to leave the cirros fullscreen.

0. Click on **Project > Compute > Instance**

0. On the right hand side of the screen, use the drop-down menu under the actions collumn to select **Associate Floating IP** to ping-box. See the screenshot below if you are lost.

    ![Lab Environment](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_lab_floating_ip_1.png)

0. Click the **+** to obtain a Floating IP address. See the screenshot below if you are lost.

    ![Lab Environment](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_lab_floating_ip_2.png)

0. Click on Allocate IP to pull 1 IP address from the pool of allocated floating IP address on the provider-net.

    ![Lab Environment](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_lab_floating_ip_3.png)
    
0. Click on the blue **Associate** button.

    ![Lab Environment](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_lab_horizon_click_associate.png)

0. Great! Now your ping-box should have a second IP address applied to it! Record this IP address.

    ![Lab Environment](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_lab_horizon_new_floating_ip.png)

0. Let's try to ping ping-box from the beachhead remote desktop once again. **Launch a new terminal session**.

0. Don't SSH anywhere. Just type the following into the new terminal session, where you'll customize the IP address with the one you recorded as applied to ping-box in the previous step.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `ping 172.16.2.`\<insert_your_ip_here\>
    >
    This command goes on forever, so you need to press **CTRL **+** C** to stop.

0. So it works! But why? Answer the following questions:

    - **Q1: What changed?**
      - A1: Applying a floating IP address to the VM makes demorouter look more like a 1:1 NAT!

0. Well if we can ping it, we should be able to SSH to it! SSH to the float IP address you applied to the machine.
    
    `student@beachhead:/$` 

6. Does "pinger" instance know that it has a floating IP address? Let's find out.
7. ssh into the floating ip address of pinger
8. run `ip link show` and note that the floating ip address does not appear.
9. So "pinger" has NO IDEA that it has a floating ip address? (Yes, it has no idea)
10. Obtain a floating ip address for later use.
