# Lab 13 - Administering Role Permissions with Groups

### TUESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to create and work with groups. Groups are a new concept in API v3. They are designed to manage access and assign roles to multiple members at once. Groups contain some number of users, all of which belong to some domain. Roles can be applied to groups, which are then inherited by those users. Again, for these to function properly, we'd want to administer the various policy.json files. Furthermore, there is still some work to be done on group functionality. However, this lab will give you practice creating and administering groups with the python-openstackclient.

### Procedure

0. Take a moment and clean up the clutter on your remote desktop environment. We don't need any old terminal windows open, so close them all, and then open a new one. Once you have a new terminal window open, SSH to controller. 

    `student@beachhead:/$` `ssh controller`

0. From controller, source the `admin.rc` file. This changes the display of the CLI prompt, and gives you OpenStack command authority as the user **admin**.

    `student@controller:~$` `source admin.rc`

0. Back to the terminal. Time to create a group. Groups are collections of users that belong to some domain. Users can be added or removed from groups. Roles can then be applied to groups, which are inherited by the users belonging to those groups. Let's create a group called `engineers` within the default domain.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack group create --domain default engineers`
    
0. Let's create a group called `technicians`.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack group create --domain default technicians`

0. List all of the groups now available for us to work with

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack group list`
       
0. We could pretend that maybe engineers have elevated permissions, where as technicians have permissions restricting them to only those activities relating to basic functions of VMs. Let's add aliceanderson to the engineers group.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack group add user engineers aliceanderson`

0. Confirm alice belongs to the group called **engineers**

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack group contains user engineers aliceanderson`
    
0. Add the role **heat_stack_owner** to the group

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack role add --domain default --group engineers heat_stack_owner`
    
    >
    No special output will be produced

0. Add bobbarker to the group called engineers

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack group add user engineers bobbarker`

0. Development on groups continues. For example, if you issue the following command, you'll find there is no quick way to list every user belonging to a perticular group with the python-openstackclient. In fact, controlling groups from the CLI is still rather limited in nature. Controlling groups in Horizon is even further limited to the creation and deletion of groups.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack help | grep group`

0. Good job! The concept of **groups** will continue to be developed, but until that time, we've learned about as much as we need; groups can be created within a domain, users can be added to groups, and roles can be applied directly to groups containing those users.
