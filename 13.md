### Lab Duration: 20 minutes

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to give students a basic introduction to git and git pull requests.  Many open source projects rely on git for decentralized collaboration including OpenStack.

#### 1. Setup Github Account (You are advised to use a personal email address for this!)

1. In a new tab, **[Create a Github account](https://github.com/join) or [Login](https://github.com/login)**

2. Navigate to the Alta3 OpenStack Glossary project by pasting the following URL into a new tab within your browser.

    `https://github.com/alta3/openstack-labs`      

3. Star the repository

    > Staring is like a bookmark on github.com,  you can view and search your stared repositories at [github.com/stars](github.com/stars)

#### 2. Fork the lab repository

1. **Fork the lab repository** into your account

#### 3. Set up your controller

1. You likely already are connected to your controller via SSHProxy, but if not, sign into your controller using the SSHProxy (https://alta3.com/sshproxy/), and then issue these commands

    `[root@controller ~]#` `mkdir ~/myopenstack``

    `[root@controller ~]#` `cd myopenstack`

    `[root@controller ~]#` `yum install git`

    `[root@controller ~]#` `git config --global user.name "--- Place your name here ---"`

    `[root@controller ~]#``git config --global user.email "---your_email@example.com---"`

    `[root@controller ~]#` `git config --list`

    `[root@controller ~]#` `git init`


2. Create a sample file to push up to github.

    `[root@controller ~]#` `history > history`

    > Add this sample text: **Look at all the commands I issued so far!**  

    `[root@controller ~]#` `git status`

    `[root@controller ~]#` `git add history`

    `[root@controller ~]#` `git commit -m 'This is supposed to add my history to my repository'`


#### 4. CREATE REPOSITORY on your github account called 'myopenstack'

1. On your github account, click #1 on **Respositories**, then click #2 the **NEW** button. ***If you are NOT logged in, you will NOT see the NEW button!***

2. On your github account, create your new repository called "myopenstack".

3. On your github account, discover your remote URL and record it.

4. At your controller SSH sesssion, link your ~/myopenstack directory to the repository you just created.

    `[root@controller ~]#` `git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-ACCOUNT-NAME-HERE/myopenstack.git`

    `[root@controller ~]#` `git push origin master`

    `[root@controller ~]#` ` # respond to login`  
    `[root@controller ~]#` ` # respond to password`

5. If (**and only if**) the above step fails, most likely your github repository is out of sync or the remote target is incorrect. Try to resolve the issue as follows:

    > Let's make sure we have the correct target!  

    `[root@controller ~]#` `git remote rm origin`

    `[root@controller ~]#` `git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-ACCOUNT-NAME-HERE/myopenstack.git`  

   > Pull down new files on the github repo in order to synchonize with the master branch.  

    `[root@controller ~]#` `git pull origin master`

    > This will sync github with your current directly

    `[root@controller ~]#` `git push origin master`

    > Now that you are synced with github, this should work
