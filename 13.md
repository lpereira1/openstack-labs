### Lab Duration: 20 minutes

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to give students a basic introduction to git and git pull requests.  Many open source projects rely on git for decentralized collaboration including OpenStack.

#### 1. Setup Github Account (You are advised to use a personal email address for this!)

1. In a new tab, **[Create a Github account](https://github.com/join) or [Login](https://github.com/login)**

2. Navigate to the Alta3 OpenStack Glossary project by pasting the following URL into a new tab within your browser.

    `https://github.com/alta3/openstack-labs`      

3. Star the repository

    > Staring is like a bookmark on github.com,  you can view and search your stared repositories at [github.com/stars](github.com/stars)

#### 2. Fork the lab repository

1. **Fork the lab repository** into your account

#### 3 Set up your controller

1. SSH into your controller and issue these commands

    `mkdir ~/myopenstack``

    `cd myopenstack`

    `yum install git`

    `git config --global user.name "---Your Name Here---"`

    `git config --global user.email "---your_email@example.com---"`

    `git config --list`

    `git init`


2. Create a sample file to push up to github.

    `history > history`

    > Add this sample text: **Look at all the commands I issued so far!**  

    `git status`

    `git add history`

    `git commit -m 'This is supposed to add my history to my repository'`


#### 4 CREATE REPOSITORY on your github account called 'myopenstack'

1. On your github account, find and click the create repository button.

2. On your github account, create your new repository called "myopenstack".

3. On your github account, discover your remote URL and record it.

4. At your controller SSH sesssion, link your ~/myopenstack directory to the repository you just created.

    `git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-ACCOUNT-NAME-HERE/myopenstack.git`

    `git push origin master`

    ` # respond to login`  
    ` # respond to password`

5. If (**and only if**) the above step fails, most likely your github repository is out of sync or the remote target is incorrect. Try to resolve the issue as follows:

    > Let's make sure we have the correct target!  

    `git remote rm origin`

    `git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-ACCOUNT-NAME-HERE/myopenstack.git`  

   > Pull down new files on the github repo in order to synchonize with the master branch.  

    `git pull origin master`

    > This will sync github with your current directly

    `git push origin master`

    > Now that you are synced with github, this should work
