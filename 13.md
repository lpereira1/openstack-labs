## Lab 13 - Administering OpenStack with Groups and Domains - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### TUESDAY

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to create and work with groups and domains. These are both highly flexible concepts. Groups are designed to manage access and assign roles to multiple members at once. The group does not contain  some number of users, all of which you'd like to inheret some common permissions. Once again, back to our story. Time to take a third order.

   - **Order 3:** The Shire would like to have their level 50 wizard, Gandalf the Grey, setup in a new project, and be able to admin a small cloud for their company.

### Procedure

0. We don't need any old terminal windows open, so close them all, and then open a new one. Once you have a new terminal window open, SSH to controller. 

    `student@beachhead:/$` `ssh controller`

0. The CLI prompt should now read as follows:

    `student@controller:~$`

0. Issue the following command to allow you to issue commands to OpenStack as admin.

    `[student@controller]#` `source admin.rc`

0. Start the python-openstackclient.
	
    `student@controller (admin) :~$`  `openstack`

	> Within the python-openstackclient, you'll be issuing commands as admin since the admin permissions were set when you executed `openstack`

4. Get a sense of the commands you can issue (they're exactly the same as before):

	`(openstack)` `help`

0. Issue the following commands to create a project for The Shire.

   `(openstack)` `project create --domain default the_shire`

0. Create the user `gandalf` with the password `noneshallpass` within the `default` domain.

   `(openstack)` `user create --project the_shire --password noneshallpass --email gandalf@theshire.example --domain default gandalf`

0. Define a role for the user `gandalf`

   `(openstack)` `role add --project the_shire --user gandalf user`
	
0. Exit the OpenStack-python environment, and return ot the CLI.

   `(openstack)` `exit`

0. Confirm that creation of the Gandalf user was successful by logging into the Horizon interface (http://controller/horizon) as `default`:`gandalf`:`noneshallpass`
