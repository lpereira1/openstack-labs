GitHub  [17] A website that enhances the functionality of Git by exposing Git users to a social community. Allows users to visualize projects and branches, host repositories, share ideas, and contact information.  
Repository  [17] The purpose of Git is to manage a project, or a set of files, as they change over time. Git stores this information in a data structure called a repository.
Bare  [17] A repository without a clear working directory, therefore, cannot be used for development work just maintain commits. The central repository is typically a bare repository. 
Non-bare  [17]  A repository with a working directory. Cloned repositories for development work are non-bare. 
Git Clone  [17]  Developers will typically clone a central repository so that they can develop in parallel. 
Git Directory  [17] The .git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project. This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another computer. Typically exists on the central repository.
Working Directory  [17]  A single version of the project. These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.
Staging Area  [17] You modify files in your working directory, then stage the files. Staged files are snapshots, but not permanently committed. Staged files are permanently snapshotted when they are committed.
Git Pull [17] Step 1. Pulls in work from the central repository, bringing your working directory to the latest version.
Git Add [17] Step 2. Adds specified files to the staging area.
Git Commit  [17] Step 3. Takes all of the files in the staging area, and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory. All commits can be referenced by a UUID, and include metadata such as the author, date, contact info, notes, etc. A commit is synonymous with version.
Git Push  [17] Step 4 Local commit is pushed to a targeted library. This can be forceful, and disrupt a current working branch, therefore, a push should only ever target the central repository (which has no working directory).
DEVOPS  [18] Software defined infrastructure. Your data center is now defined by code, permitting continuous release of new features. Nobody turns a wrench. Read the Phoenix Project to clearly understand its impact.
Immutable Infrastructure  [18] Stability, efficiency, and fidelity to your applications through automation and the use of successful patterns from programming. No rigorous or standardized definition of immutable infrastructure exists yet, but the basic idea is that you create and operate your infrastructure using the programming concept of immutability: once you instantiate something, you never change it. Instead, you replace it with another instance to make changes or ensure proper behavior.

HOT  [18] (Heat Orchestration Template) Heat input in the format native to OpenStack. Formatted in YAML.  HOT is the newer of two template formats used by heat.  If you wanted to have a stack that created two instances connected by a private network, then your template would contain the definitions for two instances, a network, a subnet, and two network ports.
CFN  [18] Short for AWS CloudFormation, this is the second template format that is supported by Heat. CFN-formatted templates are typically expressed in JSON.
Ironic  [18] OpenStack project that provisions bare metal, as opposed to VM instances.
High Availability  [19]  A high availability system design approach and associated service implementation ensures that a prearranged level of operational performance will be met during a contractual measurement period. High availability systems seeks to minimize system downtime and data loss.
