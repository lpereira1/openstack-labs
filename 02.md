## Lab 02 - Openstack python-clients and getting to help with grep - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### MONDAY

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to give students an introduction to administering an OpenStack cloud at the CLI with the Openstack python-clients. OpenStack APIs are serviced by HTTP(S) messages, which are tedious and burdosome for a human to write. The purpose of all of the python-clients is to translate simple CLI commands into complex HTTP(S) messages, as well as 'cherry pick' content out of the HTTP(S) responses, and print them to the screen.

### Procedure

0. Check out all of the Openstack python-clients available, and currently in development: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OpenStackClients

  > At one time, every service at the CLI was accessed using a dedicated python-client. This was chaotic as no two python-clients worked EXACTLY the same way.  OpenStack is attempting to 'unite' all of the OpenStack commands inside of a common python 'wrapper', or a platform that allows you to issue a common set of commands for every OpenStack service. 

0. Start an SSH session to controller.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `ssh controller`
    
0. Check out the old **python-keystoneclient** that is being depricated (phased out). It is easy to get 'stuck' if this is your first time using the **less** command. **Less** is a way to easily parse large amounts of text from the CLI. Just know that the **q** key will always let you quit

    `student@controller:~$` `keystone help | less`
	
    > Have you used *less* before?  If not, then these hints are for you:  
    *Quit:* Press `q` to quit less  
    Scroll down: Press the down arrow  
    Scroll up: Press the up arrow to scroll back up  
    Foward one window: CTRL + F  
    Back one window: CTRL + B

0. After you scroll up and down, and have reviewed a few **python-keystoneclient** commands, do the same thing to the **python-novaclient**.

    `student@controller:~$` `nova help | less`

0. Finally, check out the **python-cinderclient**

    `student@controller:~$` `cinder help | less`

0. We are exploring the **OLD** way to issue commands to OpenStack at the CLI. Back then, if you wanted to issue commands to the Keystone service, you would type **keystone command**. If you wanted to issue commands to Nova service, you would type **nova command**, and so on. The community felt that this was bad UI design, so the **NEW** way of issuing commands is to, in as many cases as possible, just type **openstack**.

0. Launch the **python-openstackclient** environment

    `student@controller:~$` `openstack`
	
0. Display the **python-openstackclient** commands. They'll go past quickly. We'll deal with that issue in a moment.
    
    `(openstack)` `help`

0. Exit the **python-openstackclient**
	
    `(openstack)` `exit`

0. You can also issue commands directly to the **python-openstackclient** without entering the client environment. 

    `student@controller:~$` `openstack help`

0. Use the less command to review all of the commands associated with the **python-openstackclient**. Remember, the **q** key will always let you quit Less.
	
    `student@controller:~$` `openstack help | less`
	
    > Have you used *less* before?  If not, then these hints are for you:  
    *Quit:* Press `q` to quit less  
    Scroll down: Press the down arrow (you start out at the top of the service catalog)  
    Scroll up: Press the up arrow to scroll back up  
    Foward one window: CTRL + F  
    Back one window: CTRL + B  
    Less utility cheat sheet (http://sheet.shiar.nl/less)

0. That's a tremendous amount of commands, and you can't be expected to commit them all to memory. So, let's practice one simple way to quickly find commands we want. This can be done with the **grep** (**globally search regular expression and print**) command, which works essentially like a search. Start by pretending you wanted to create a volume, but didn't know the command to do so. You might issue a command like the following. 

    `student@controller:~$` `openstack help | grep volume`

0. Let's try another one. First clear off your screen.

    `student@controller:~$` `clear`

0. Pretend you are an admin in need of creating or manipulating a user in some way.

    `student@controller:~$` `openstack help | grep user`
    
0. Being able to **grep** help to find the command you are looking for is a critical to skill if your goal is to become a tallented openstack administrator.

0. That concludes your intro to the OpenStack python-clients. Now that you've had a little exposure to them, it might be helpful to once again revisit list of clients over at https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OpenStackClients. For example, note that only the python-keystoneclient has been fully depricated. That means at this time, we still may find ourselves typing **nova** or **cinder** or **glance** (and so on), at the CLI, until more work is done on the **python-openstackclient**.
