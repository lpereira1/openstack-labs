### WEDNESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective
The objective of this lab is to describe how key-pairs are implimented within cloud environments to provide a connection that makes logging into an instance both easy and **very** secure. SSH key-pairs are asymmetric cryptography that involve the simultaneous creation of two keys, one is secret (private), and the other is public.

**User Private Key** is kept secret by the SSH user on his client machine (think of this as the 'password'). The user must **NEVER** reveal the private key to anyone, including the system admin, or their identity is compromised.

**User Public Key** is registered to the server the user is trying to access. In order to make the private key work, your public key must be installed onto your instance prior to being able to log into it.

### Procedure

0. From your remote desktop, open a terminal session, and move to the student home directory.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd`

0. Change directory to `.ssh`

    `student@beachhead:~$` `cd .ssh`

0. List the contents of the directory

    `student@beachhead:~/.ssh$` `ll`

0. You will see five files:

    - **authorized_keys** - are public keys from other users that are authorized to access your machine.  
    
    - **config** - An extremely handy list of shortcuts to SSH into other systems. Adding more hosts to this list makes it easy to navigate your cloud.
    
    - **id_rsa** is your private key. Give this key to no one and remember to keep it secure.
    
    - **id_rsa.pub** - This is your public key, which you will want to copy into your new instances so you can easily connect to them.
    
    - **known_hosts** - Allows the client to authenticate the server, ensuring that we are not connecting to an impersonator.
    
0. Answer the following question:

    - **Q1: What is a key-pair?**
      - A1: The **id_rsa** and **id_rsa_pub** are a matched set. They go together. When you connect to an instance, these two files are the "key-pair" we are talking about. 

0. Run the cat command on your public key. It will look like this:
    
    `student@beachhead:~/.ssh$` `cat id_rsa.pub`

0. Using your mouse, highlight **your** key from **your** terminal, click-click, and copy.

0. Open Firefox, and connect to Horizon. Sign in as **default:admin:alta3**

0. Naviate to ** Project > Compute > Access & Security**

0. Click on the **Key Pairs** tab

0. Click the **Import Key Pair** button

0. Enter the name **student-key** in the Key Pair Name

0. Paste the key you copied from **id_rsa.pub**

0. Click the **Import Key Pair** button.

0. Navigate to **Project > Compute > Instances**

0. In the upper right corner, click the **Launch Instance** button 

    ![launch instance](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_create_VM_in_horizon.png)

0. The Launch Instance dialog box will pop up. Fill out each tab as follows:

    >
      **Details Tab**
    >
      Instance Name: keyed-access
    >
      Availability Zone: nova (or az1 or az2)
    >
      Count: 1
    >
      **Source**
    >
      Select Boot Source: Image (from drop down menu)
    >
      Create New Volume: No
    >
      Allocated: cirros (selected by pressing the + button)
    >
      **Flavor**
    >
      Allocated: m1.tiny (selected by pressing the + button)
    >
      **Networks**
    >
      Allocated: demo-net (selected by pressing the + button)
    >
      **Network Ports**
    >
      (No changes)
    >
      **Security Groups**
    >
      Allocated: icmp-ssh (selected by pressing the + button)
    >
      **Key Pair**
    >
      (No changes) **IMPORTANT:** *Take notice that student-key (the **User Public Key**) has been automatically allocated to this VM* 
    >
      **Configuration**
    >
      (No changes)
    >
      **Metadata**
    >
    (No changes)
    >
    
0. Once complete, **click the 'Launch' button**. 

0. Apply a Floating-IP address to the new VM **keyed-access** (we've done this a few times before, but if you forgot... from the drop down menu on the same line as **keyed-access**... select associate floating IP address... a popup window will come up... click the plus... click associate floating IP... click associate...)

0. Almost done. Now back to the terminal

    `student@beachhead:~/.ssh$` `cd`

0. Now just SSH to the machine... only you won't need a 'password' this time!

    `student@beachhead:~$` `ssh cirros@<FLOATING_IP_ADDRESS_OF_keyed-access>`

0. Great job! That concludes this lab.
