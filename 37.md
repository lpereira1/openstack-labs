### THURSDAY - &#x1F680;OPTIONAL&#x1F680;

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to learn to deploy the python-openstackclient. API endpoints are interacted with via python-clients. There are many "one-off" clients that target a single OpenStack project's APIs, however one OpenStack python-client seeks to 'rule them all'. This client is known as the python-openstackclient.

The following link demonstrates the installation process on other computing platforms (Windows, Mac OS, and various Linux distros), in addition to explaining how to install other "one-off" clients: https://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/common/cli-install-openstack-command-line-clients.html

### Procedure

0. From your remote desktop, open a terminal session, and move to the student home directory.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd`

0. Confirm that the python-openstackclient is not currently installed. To be clear, the following command should fail.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `openstack`

0. The only prerequisite here is that python is installed. It is, but it won't hurt to re-run the command that installs it.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo apt install python-dev python-pip`

0. Now, install the python-openstackclient.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `pip install python-openstackclient`
    
0. That was easy! Test to see that the client is properly installed.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `openstack`

0. If it worked, your environment should have changed to **(openstack)**. Exit the environment.

    `(openstack)` `exit`
    
0. Before we can issue any commands, we need to replicate an RC file here on Beachhead. Let's use vim to create an **admin.rc**

    `student@beachhead:~$` `vim admin.rc`
