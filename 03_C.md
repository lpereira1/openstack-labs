title: "Lab 02 - Taking Control of a Project as admin"
---

## Lab XY - Adding a User at the CLI within the OpenStack-python Environment - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50; - MONDAY

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is the same as one you performed earlier; create a project and user at the CLI. However, this time we'll enter the OpenStack-python environment at the CLI. This is just another way to issue commands at the CLI. Once again, back to our story. Time to take a third order.

   - **Order 3:** The Shire would like to have their level 50 wizard, Gandalf the Grey, setup in a new project, and be able to admin a small cloud for their company.

### Procedure

0. SSH into your controller as root (if you are not already)

0. If you are not sourced as admin already, issue the following command:
	
	`[root@controller]#` `source admin.rc`
	   > It doesn't hurt to perform this step 'again', if you're already sourced as admin.

0. Start the python-openstackclient
	
    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `openstack`

	> Within the python-openstackclient, you'll be issuing commands as admin since the admin permissions were set when you executed `openstack`

4. Get a sense of the commands you can issue:

	`(openstack)` `help`
