### WEDNESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to explore how floating IP addresses work. To do so, we will create an instance on demo-net called, "ping-box".

### Procedure

0. Use Firefox within your remote desktop to log into Horizon (http://controller/horizon) as **:default:admin:alta3:**

0. First we want to create a security group, that allows ICMP and SSH. This can be created just like in the last lab. In case you forgot, we'll walk you through it quickly.

0. Click on **Project > Compute > Access & Security** (along the left).

0. Click on the white **'Create Security Group'** button (top right), then fill out the resulting pop up as follows:

    ```
    Name: icmp-ssh
    Description: Allows pings and SSH
    ```
 
0. Click the blue **Create Security Group** button

0. Now click on the white **Manage rules** button for the new **icmp-ssh** security group you just created.

0. Click on the **+Add Rule** button (top right)

0. Fill out the resulting rule as follows:

    ```
    Rule: All ICMP
    Direction: Ingress
    Remote: CIDR
    CIDR: 0.0.0.0/0
    ```

0. Click the blue **Add** button when you finish.

0. Repeat that step again, but this time for SSH. Click on the **+Add Rule** button (top right)

0. Fill out the resulting rule as follows:

    ```
    Rule: SSH
    Remote: CIDR
    CIDR: 0.0.0.0/0
    ```

0. Click the blue **Add** button when you finish.

0. Great job! Time to launch the instance. Click on **Project > Compute > Instances**

0. In the upper right hand corner, click the **'Launch Instance' button**.

0. Fill the pop-up outlining the details of the instance as follows:

    >
      **Details Tab**
    >
      Instance Name: ping-box
    >
      Availability Zone: nova (or az1 or az2)
    >
      Count: 1
    >
      **Source**
    >
      Select Boot Source: Image (from drop down menu)
    >
      Create New Volume: No
    >
      Allocated: cirros (selected by pressing the + button)
    >
      **Flavor**
    >
      Allocated: m1.tiny (selected by pressing the + button)
    >
      **Networks**
    >
      Allocated: demo-net (selected by pressing the + button)
    >
      **Network Ports**
    >
      (No changes)
    >
      **Security Groups**
    >
      Add Security Group called "icmp-ssh"
    >
      **Key Pair**
    >
      (No changes)
    >
      **Configuration**
    >
      (No changes)
    >
      **Metadata**
    >
    (No changes)
    >
    
0. Once complete, **Click 'Launch'**. You screen should now look like the following sreen shot. It is ok if your IP address isn't 192.168.30.4, but it should be in the 192.168.30.0/24 range.
    
    > If the IP is not in that ranage, you didn't launch the VM on demo-net.

    ![Proper IP Range](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_horizon_ping_box_vm.png)

0. Write down the IP address of your **ping-box**, we'll need it later.

0. Click on the name **ping-box**

0. Click on the **console** tab

0. Click on the blue link that says **Click here to show only console**

0. Hit enter a few times to wake up the console (sometimes the screen is all black).

0. Log into the cirros box with the Login of **cirros** and the password of **cubswin:)**
    
    >
    Note, the password will not appear as you type!
    
0. If the cursor becomes a dollar sign, you're logged in. See the screenshot below if you are lost.

    ![VNC Session](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_horizon_cirros_novnc.png)

0. Issue the following command in cirros to attempt to ping beachhead (your remote desktop).

    `$` `ping 172.16.1.4`
    
    >
    This command goes on forever, so you need to press **CTRL **+** C** to stop.

0. Okay, so the ping-box can ping the remote desktop. Try to ping a well known Google public DNS server.

    `$` `ping 8.8.8.8`
    
    >
    This command goes on forever, so you need to press **CTRL **+** C** to stop.

0. So, the ping-box can even hit an IP address out on the public web. COOL!

0. See if you can ping ping-box from the beachhead remote desktop. **It will not work**, but do it anyways to prove a point.

0. **Launch a new terminal session**.

0. Don't SSH anywhere. Just type the following into the new terminal session, where you'll customize the IP address with the one you recorded as applied to ping-box in the previous step. Again, this **will not** work.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `ping 192.168.30.`\<insert_your_ip_here\>
    >
    This command goes on forever, so you need to press **CTRL **+** C** to stop.
    
0. Close the terminal session to *student@beachhead*, we're done with it for now.

0. Well that didn't work. Let's think about why. Answer the following questions:

    - **Q1: Does the VM have the correct security group applied?**
      - A1: Yes. We made a custom security group called icmp-ssh and allowed ICMP and SSH traffic in to the VM.
    - **Q2: Could it be that the router (demo-router) that is connected to 192.168.30.0/24 is a NAT?**
      - A2: Yes! So what we need is an IP address on a network that isn't behind the NAT if we want anyone outside of this network to be able to talk to us. This is also called a floating IP address.

0. In the Firefox session within the remote desktop, press the back button to leave the cirros fullscreen.

0. Click on **Project > Compute > Instance**

0. On the right hand side of the screen, use the drop-down menu under the actions collumn to select **Associate Floating IP** to ping-box. See the screenshot below if you are lost.

    ![Getting started with Floating IP](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_floating_ip_1.png)

0. Click the **+** to obtain a Floating IP address. See the screenshot below if you are lost.

    ![Click the plus sign](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_floating_ip_2.png)

0. Click on Allocate IP to pull 1 IP address from the pool of allocated floating IP address on the provider-net.

    ![Allocate from pool](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_floating_ip_3.png)
    
0. Click on the blue **Associate** button.

    ![Press the associate button](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_horizon_click_associate.png)

0. Great! Now your ping-box should have a second IP address applied to it! Record this IP address.

    ![Second IP address](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_horizon_new_floating_ip.png)

0. Let's try to ping ping-box from the beachhead remote desktop once again. **Launch a new terminal session**.

0. Don't SSH anywhere. Just type the following into the new terminal session, where you'll customize the IP address with the one you recorded as applied to ping-box in the previous step.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `ping 172.16.2.`\<insert_your_ip_here\>
    >
    This command goes on forever, so you need to press **CTRL **+** C** to stop.

0. So it works! But why? Answer the following questions:

    - **Q1: What changed?**
      - A1: Applying a floating IP address to the VM makes demorouter look more like a 1:1 NAT!

0. Well if we can ping it, we should be able to SSH to it! SSH to the float IP address you applied to the machine.
    
    `student@beachhead:/$` 

0. Does the ping-box instance *know* that it has a floating IP address? Let's find out. 

0. SSH into the **floating ip address** of ping-box

    `student@beachhead:/$` `ssh cirros@172.16.2.`\<insert_your_ip_here\>
    >
    Type 'yes' to agree to the key.
    >
    The password is cubswin:) <- include the smiley!
    
0. Run **ip link show** and note that the floating ip address does not appear.

    `$` `ip addr show`

0. Look at the output, then answer the following question:

    - **Q1: So the ping-box instance has NO IDEA that it has a floating ip address?**
      - A1: Correct! The ping-box has no clue what the floating IP address is.
      
0. Clean up your desktop or you'll get lost. We're done with all the terminals. So close them all.

0. Before we finish this lab, let's obtain a floating ip address for later use. Click on **Project > Compute > Access & Security**

0. Click on the **Floating IP address tab**

0. Click on the white **Allocate IP To Project** button. See the screenshot below if you are lost.

    ![Allocate IP to Project](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_floating_ip_5.png)

0. Click on the blue **Allocate IP** button

    ![Allocate the Floating IP](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_floating_ip_6.png)

0. The floating IP address is now waiting to assign to an instance (VM).

    ![Floating IP Created](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_floating_ip_7.png)

0. Good job! That's it for this lab.
