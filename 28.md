### THURSDAY- &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective 

The objective of this lab is to create a block storage volume with Cinder and then attach it to a VM instance. This is the virtual equivalent of plugging a new drive into a computer. Just like a physical drive, volumes can be attached, detached, reattached, and moved between VM instances.

#### Creating a block storage volume with Horizon

0. Make sure that the cinder volumes are present!

    `[root@controller ~]#` `pvdisplay`

    ```
  --- Physical volume ---
  PV Name               /dev/sdb
  VG Name               cinder-volumes
  PV Size               1.36 TiB / not usable 3.40 MiB
  Allocatable           yes
  PE Size               4.00 MiB
  Total PE              357699
  Free PE               357699
  Allocated PE          0
  PV UUID               wvXaPJ-l9GV-qbJa-Sc5l-D0Gz-ohnM-v6MMkk

  --- Physical volume ---
  PV Name               /dev/sda5
  VG Name               controller-vg
  PV Size               1.36 TiB / not usable 2.00 MiB
  Allocatable           yes (but full)
  PE Size               4.00 MiB
  Total PE              357577
  Free PE               0
  Allocated PE          357577
  PV UUID               X8HdfM-eusf-Gl1k-kzMS-vAM2-h6Y8-X8R9kO
    ```

    > It is critical that you see **VG Name = cinder-volumes**  
    > If you do, then you are good, move on to the next step  
    > **OTHERWISE**, please let your instructor know!      
    > The Logical Volume Group must be reinstalled as follows:  
    > `vgcreate cinder-volumes /dev/loop1`  
    > `systemctl restart openstack-cinder-volume.service`  


0. Log into Horizon as `default:chestercopperpot:fa5tpa55w0rd`

0. Navigate to **Project > Compute > Volumes**

0. Click on the button **+Create Volume** (Look in the upper right corner)

0. Fill out the pop-up window as follows:

    ```
    Name: cargo-bay
    Description: new volume for vt2
    Volume Source: No source, empty volume
    Type: No volume type
    Size (GB): 1
    Availability Zone: nova
    ```
	
0. Click the **Create Volume** button

0. Let's attach this volume to our VM instance (vt2)

0. Under **Actions** click the drop down menu, and then select **Manage Attachments**
	
0. In the pop-up window, select (vt2) from the drop down menu

0. Click the **Attach Volume** button

	> The volume will now be attached and mounted by our instance (vt2). It will take 10 or so seconds to attach.
	
0. Answer the following questions:
    - **Q1: Is the volume being actively used by the instance (is it in-use)?**
      - A1: Yes, the status is shown as In-use.
    - **Q2: Where is the volume attached on vt2?**
      - Q2: It is attached to vt2 on /dev/vdb
    - **Q3: Is this a bootable volume?**
      - Q3: No
    - **Q4: Could you detach this volume, and attach it to a difference instance?**
      - Q4: Yes. Think of this volume as you might a USB thumbdrive.
	
0. Before we finish in Horizon, make sure vt2 is active and running (powered on). Navigate to **Project > Compute > Instance**, and then click the **Start Instace** beside vt2 if it is currently listed as Shutoff and Shut down (powered off). If vt2 is not powered off, but instead suspended, then you will need to select **Resume Instance** from the **Actions** dropdown menu.
