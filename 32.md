# Lab 32 - Creating a Stack with Heat

### THURSDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to show students how to launch a Heat stack using a pre-written template.

### Procedure

0. From your remote desktop, open a terminal session, and move to the student home directory.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `ssh controller`

0. Source yourself as the admin user, run **source admin.rc**

    `student@controller:~$` `source admin.rc`

0. First, let's confirm that Heat is available. The following command should return an empty line.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack stack list`

0. Okay, great. Now let's prepare to creat a stack. Retrieve the list of available flavors on your system (this is review).

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack flavor list`
    
0. Continuing to create our stack. Retrieve the list of available images on your system (this is review).

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack image list`
    
0. After we launch an instance with Heat, you'll want to be able to SSH into with a keypair. Let's produce a key just for use with our machines created with Heat (this is review).

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack keypair create heat_key > heat_key.priv`
    
0. Change the permissions on the key we created, so that it is usable.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `chmod 600 heat_key.priv`

0. We've already created a Heat template for use with this lab. Download it, and inspect it.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alta3/openstack-labs/master/heat_cirros.yaml`

0. Review the stack template, and then answer the following questions.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `cat heat_cirros.yaml`

0. Run the stack.
 
    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack stack create -t heat_cirros.yaml --parameter key_name=heat_key teststack`
 
0. It failed. Why?
    
0. Run the new stack, this time, we will indicate with two new parameters the network and subnet we want to launch the instance on. This should fix our previous issue.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack stack create -t heat_cirros.yaml --parameter key_name=heat_key --parameter network_name=demo-net teststack`

0. Examine the state of the launched stack.
 
    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack stack event list teststack`

0. Log into Horizon as **admin**

0. Navigate to Project > Compute > Instances. You should see a new VM has been created with a name that begins **teststack-alta3_heat_stack**. This is the resource that your template created.

0. Navigate to Project > Network > Network Topology. You should see your new instance is connected to demo-net

0. Navigate to Project > Orchestration > Stacks. You should see a 'stack' here.

0. Change the security group on the VM so that SSH is allowed (port 22). You should know how to do this by now, but if you need a reminder, sign in to Horizon as admin, then navigate to Project > Compute > Instances. Select "Edit Security Group" on the drop down menu beside your new VM, then add a security group (icmp-ssh) to the VM.

0. Reserve an Floating IP, and then apply it to the new cirros VM.
    
0. Back at the CLI, try to SSH to the new cirros VM. Use the heat keypair you created to SSH in without needing to enter a password.
 
    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `ssh -i heat_key.priv cirros@`*<floating_IP>*
