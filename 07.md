### MONDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

Acme Inc wanted two users to be available to admin their systems, Alice Anderson and Bob Barker, so lets add them now that we have the project space created.

### Procedure

0. Log in to Horizon as admin. On the left hand side of the OpenStack Horizon GUI, **click on Identity > Users**

0. In the upper right hand corner, **click the '+Create User' button.**

0. **Fill out the 'Create User'** screen as follows and **click Create User**

    > White spaces and capitals may be used, but they make the login more complex, so please don't use them. 

    ```
    User Name: aliceanderson     
    Description: An employee of Acme Inc.
    Email: alice@example.com
    Password: fa5tpa55w0rd
    Confirm Password: fa5tpa55w0rd
    Primary Project: acme_inc
    Role: user
    [X] Enabled
    ```

0. Examine your work! Within the **Identity > Users** screen, you'll now find an aliceanderson user, part of the acme_inc project.

0. **Create a second user,** this will be the Bob Barker profile. Once again, **click the '+Create User' button.**

    **Fill out the second 'Create User'** screen and **click Create User**

    ```
    User Name: bobbarker     
    Description: An employee of Acme Inc.
    Email: bob@example.com
    Password: fa5tpa55w0rd
    Confirm Password: fa5tpa55w0rd
    Primary Project: acme_inc
    Role: user
    [X] Enabled
    ```


0. Log out the admin account within the Horizon GUI by clicking in the upper right hand corner, and **click 'Sign Out'**.

0. Log in as **`default:aliceanderson:fa5tpa55w0rd`**

0. **Click on Project > Compute > Overview**

    > This screen should look quite a bit different than the overview screen you saw when you were logged in as admin. Notice that Alice Anderson may only create a total of 2 instances, and utilize a total of 2 VCPUs. These settings reflect what was provisioned in the Project's Quota tab.
    > 
    > If you forget what the admin quota screen looked like, sign out, and sign back in as admin. It is important that you understand that Alice Anderson is a user within a project (tenant), therefore she may only utilize the resources that have been made permissible to the project for which she belongs (acme_inc).
    > 
0. Sign back in as **admin** and feel free to create another user within the **acme_inc** project (if you'd like). Once you're sure you have the knack of creating users with Horizon, you're done with this lab! Good job!
