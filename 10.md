### MONDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to teach how to create a project and user at the CLI (same as we did in Horizon). Now let's get back to our story. Time to take a second order.

   - **Order 2:** Vault Tek would like one user, Chester Copperpot, to be able to admin a small cloud for their company.

### Procedure

0. A lot of our labs start out this way, but it will help keep you on track, so once again, take a moment and clean up and clutter on your remote desktop environment. We don't need any old terminal windows open, so close them all, and then open a new one. Once you have a new terminal window open, SSH to controller. 

    `student@beachhead:/$` `ssh controller`

0. The CLI prompt should now read as follows:

    `student@controller:~$`

0. Export the admin environmental variables to the bash environment. This will prevent you from issuing needlessly long CLI commands. This is covered more extensively in another lesson. For now, to put it another way, the following command will allow you to issue commands to OpenStack as admin.

    `[student@controller]#` `source admin.rc`

0.  Keystone's job is management of users and credentials. Issue this command to the keystone service to create a new tenant.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack project create --domain default vault_tek`
    ```
    +-------------+----------------------------------+
| Field       | Value                            |
+-------------+----------------------------------+
| description |                                  |
| domain_id   | 815061df07e64a0a80cfe21fa34f24c9 |
| enabled     | True                             |
| id          | 0b31eed251284eff92ecac817ec9e5b1 |
| is_domain   | False                            |
| name        | vault_tek                        |
| parent_id   | 815061df07e64a0a80cfe21fa34f24c9 |
+-------------+----------------------------------+
    ```


0. Create the user chestercopperpot, within the domain default, in the project (tenant) vault_tek, with the password fa5tpa55w0rd, and the email address chester@vaulttek.example.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack user create --project vault_tek --password fa5tpa55w0rd --email chester@vaulttek.example --domain default chestercopperpot`

    > If this command is successfully run, you should see output similar to below:

    ``` 
    +--------------------+----------------------------------+
    | Field              | Value                            |
    +--------------------+----------------------------------+
    | default_project_id | 6417af4dea224c5999e89a7634d27645 |
    | domain_id          | f7fec41f3beb41d29896c6aeb2c34b58 |
    | email              | chester@vaulttek.com             |
    | enabled            | True                             |
    | id                 | bbd00ac0ce7c410198ffcac13d26932c |
    | name               | chestercopperpot                 |
    +--------------------+----------------------------------+
    ```

0. Add a role to Chestercopperpot

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack role add --project vault_tek --user chestercopperpot user`

0. Display the tenants (projects) currently available. 

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack project list`
	
    > The results look like this and are analogous to the Identity > Projects page in the Horizon dashboard.

    ```

    ```

0. Display the users that have been created in the system. 

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack user list`

    > The results look like this:

0. Log in to the **Horizon interface** as **`default:chestercopperpot:fa5tpa55w0rd`**

 * If you have forgotten how to get to Horizon, simply navigate to http://controller/horizon in Firefox within your remote desktop 
 
0. Once logged in, you should be part of the new project called **vault_tek** within the domain called **default**. Your screen should look like the screenshot below:

    ![Logged In to Horizon](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_horizon_project_user_view.png)

0. We logged into Horizon in the previous lab, but if you are new to OpenStack, click around, and make sure everything appears as you would expect it to within the OpenStack Horizon dashboard.

    - **Q1: How can you quickly identify the project that you are a part of in Horizon?**
       - A1: Look in the upper left corner of Horizon.
      
0. Good job! Now you know how to create a user at the CLI using the python-openstackclient!
