### TUESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to introdce how the Keystone Service Catalog is built. When the cloud is constructed, Keystone is the first to be installed. As other services are added to the OpenStack Cloud, their API endpoints must be added to Keystone's Service Catalog, so that they can be advertisted within the cloud. In this lab, we'll add a fictious service to our cloud, so that you understand how the Service Catalog is constructed.

### Procedure

0. We don't need any old terminal windows open, so close them all, and then open a new one. Once you have a new terminal window open, SSH to controller. 

    `student@beachhead:/$` `ssh controller`

0. The CLI prompt should now read as follows:

    `student@controller:~$`

0. Source ad the **admin.rc file** to issue commands as the admin user.

    `student@controller:~$` `source admin.rc`
    
0. Take a look at the current service catalog

    `student@controller:~$` `openstack catalog list`

0. We want to add a new service to our cloud that enables the storage and organziation of photos. Before we add our new service, review the command usage.

    `student@controller:~$` `openstack help service create`

0. Issue the following command to make the new service. Let's name it **photostorage**, apply a description of **photo storage as a service** and describe type of service as **photo**

    `student@controller:~$` `openstack service create --name photostorage --description "photo storage as a service" photo`
    
0. Retrieve the Storage Catalog once again. Notice that there are no URL API endpoints listed for our new photo service.

    `student@controller:~$` `openstack catalog list`
    
0. Defining API endpoints is easy! For that we use the **endpoint create** command. We'll need to create (3) API endpoints. Let's review what each type is:

    - **admin API** - An endpoint reserved for admin tasks, for example, the admin URL API for Keystone allows for the addition and creation of new users and projects, while the public and internal do not.
    - **internal API** - An endpoint reserved for non-admin tasks, accessable from within the LAN.
    - **public API** - An endpoint reserved for non-admin tasks, accessable across a WAN.
    
0. Review the usage of the command to create a new endpoint.

    `student@controller:~$` `openstack help endpoint create`

0. Create the admin URL API as follows:

    `student@controller:~$` `openstack endpoint create --region RegionOne photo admin http://example.org:10101`
    
0. Two more... create the public URL API as follows:

    `student@controller:~$` `openstack endpoint create --region RegionOne photo public http://example.org:10104`
    
0. Last one! Create the internal URL API as follows:

    `student@controller:~$` `openstack endpoint create --region RegionOne photo internal http://example.org:10104`
    
0. Review the catalog.

    `student@controller:~$` `openstack catalog list`

0. If you'd like to get a listing of all of the endpoints, you can do that too!

    `student@controller:~$` `openstack endpoint list`

0. That could be a bit overwhelming. Try agumenting that command with the linux **grep** command. This line asks for the same output, but also refines the display by only displaying those that contain the word *photo*

    `student@controller:~$` `openstack endpoint list | grep photo`

0. Good job! That's it for this lab.
