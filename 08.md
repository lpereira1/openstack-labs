## Lab 08 - Launching Instances as a User - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### MONDAY

### Lab Objective

Now that Alice Anderson and Bob Barker have been added to the project space Acme Inc, we want to sign in as those users and confirm that they can launch instances (create infastructure). The marketing department would call this, "Infastructure As A Service", and is the product Acme Inc is paying us for.

### Procedure

0. Double check that you are signed in as `default:aliceanderson:fa5tpa55w0rd` 

    > Notice that the project in the upper left change has changed. You should be signed in as the user aliceanderson, within the default domain, and the project acme_inc.

0. **Click on Project > Compute > Instances**
0. In the upper right corner, **click 'Launch Instance'**

0. The Launch Instance dialog box will pop up. Fill out each tab as follows:

 **Details Tab**
    ```
    Instance Name: acme_vm1
    Availability Zone: nova
    Count: 1
    ```
    
 **Source**
    ```
    Select Boot Source: Image (from drop down menu)
    Create New Volume: No
    Allocated: cirros (selected by pressing the + button)
    ```
    
 **Flavor**
    ```
    Allocated: m1.xlarge (selected by pressing the + button)
    ```

 **Networks**
    ```
    Allocated: fabric (selected by pressing the + button)
    ```
    
 **Network Ports**
    ```
    (No changes)
    ```
    
 **Security Groups**
    ```
    (No changes)
    ```
    
 **Key Pair**
    ```
    (No changes)
    ```
    
 **Configuration**
    ```
    (No changes)
    ```
    
 **Metadata**
    ```
    (No changes)
    ```
    
0. **Click 'Launch'**, and the instance will **fail**. 

    > That's OK, just driving home the point that the project acme_inc does not have enough resources provisioned by their quota to boot the m1.xlarge flavor (the flavor is the amount of resources devoted to a VM). The problem is that the m1.xlarge flavor wants to run 8 VCPUs, and we only have 2 available to our project.

0. Let's try again, this time, configure the instance with a samller flavor so it boots:

 **Details Tab**
    ```
    Instance Name: acme_vm1
    Availability Zone: nova
    Count: 1
    ```
    
 **Source**
    ```
    Select Boot Source: Image (from drop down menu)
    Create New Volume: No
    Allocated: cirros (selected by pressing the + button)
    ```
    
 **Flavor**
    ```
    Allocated: m1.tiny (selected by pressing the + button)
    ```
    
 **Networks**
    ```
    Allocated: fabric
    ```
    
 **Network Ports**
    ```
    (No changes)
    ```
    
 **Security Groups**
    ```
    (No changes)
    ```
    
 **Key Pair**
    ```
    (No changes)
    ```
    
 **Configuration**
    ```
    (No changes)
    ```
    
 **Metadata**
    ```
    (No changes)
    ```

0. Once complete, **click the 'Launch' button**

    > Immediately upon launching the instance (virtual machine), it will begin spawning. How long the instance takes to spawn is completely dependent on how many resources the instance has been created with, and how the the underlying OpenStack architecture has been designed. Thankfully, the Alta3 Research datacenter is strapped with killer hardware, so it shouldn't take too long at all :p

0. Once the instance changes from 'Spawning' to 'Running', **sign out of the aliceanderson account**

0. **Log in as** `default:bobbarker:fa5tpa55w0rd`

0. Click on **Project > Compute > Overview**

    > You should see the same total available resources that the account aliceanderson saw. Remember, both Alice and Bob are part of the same project (acme_inc)

0. **Click on Project > Compute > Instances**

    > You should still see the same instance that the account aliceanderson saw. Again, both Alice and Bob are part of the same project (acme_inc)

0. Logged in as bobbarker, **click on the 'Launch Instance' button**, then create the following instance:

 **Details Tab**
    ```
    Instance Name: acme_vm2
    Availability Zone: nova
    Count: 1
    ```
    
 **Source**
    ```
    Select Boot Source: Image (from drop down menu)
    Create New Volume: No
    Allocated: cirros (selected by pressing the + button)
    ```
    
 **Flavor**
    ```
    Allocated: m1.tiny (selected by pressing the + button)
    ```
    
 **Networks**
    ```
    Allocated: fabric
    ```
    
 **Network Ports**
    ```
    (No changes)
    ```
    
 **Security Groups**
    ```
    (No changes)
    ```
    
 **Key Pair**
    ```
    (No changes)
    ```
    
 **Configuration**
    ```
    (No changes)
    ```
    
 **Metadata**
    ```
    (No changes)
    ```
    
0. Once complete, **click the 'Launch' button**, and wait for the acme_vm2 instance to finish spawning (this should only take seconds).


0. Once acme_vm2 is running, **click on Project > Compute > Overview**

    > Spend a few minutes checking out this screen. Notice that no more instances or VCPUs are available for this project. It should look similar to the screen shot below:
