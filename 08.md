### MONDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

Now that Alice Anderson and Bob Barker have been added to the project space Acme Inc, we want to sign in as those users and confirm that they can launch instances (create infrastructure). The marketing department would call this, "Infrastructure As A Service", and is the product Acme Inc is paying us for.

### Procedure

0. Within the remote desktop, double check that you are signed in the Horizon interface as **`default:aliceanderson:fa5tpa55w0rd`**. In case you forgot, the Horizon interface is available via http://controller/horizon

    > If you are struggling to figure out how to determine who you are signed into Horizon as, check the upper right corner. It should be displaying that the signed in user is **aliceanderson**.
    
0. **Click on Project > Compute > Instances**

0. In the upper right corner, **click 'Launch Instance'** 

    ![launch instance](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_create_VM_in_horizon.png)

0. The Launch Instance dialog box will pop up. Fill out each tab as follows:

    >
      **Details Tab**
    >
      Instance Name: acme_vm1
    >
      Availability Zone: nova
    >
      Count: 1
    >
      **Source**
    >
      Select Boot Source: Image (from drop down menu)
    >
      Create New Volume: No
    >
      Allocated: cirros (selections are made by pressing the + button, and removed by pressing the - button)
    >
      **Flavor**
    >
      Allocated: m1.tiny (selections are made by pressing the + button, and removed by pressing the - button)
    >
      **Networks**
    >
      Allocated: provider-net (selections are made by pressing the + button, and removed by pressing the - button)
    >
      **Network Ports**
    >
      (No changes)
    >
      **Security Groups**
    >
      (No changes)
    >
      **Key Pair**
    >
      (No changes)
    >
      **Configuration**
    >
      (No changes)
    >
      **Metadata**
    >
    (No changes)
    >
    
0. Once complete, **Click 'Launch'**. 

0. Did you take time to fully investigate the flavor tab? Just in case you missed it, take a look at the following screenshot, and notice that Alice is unable to launch a machine with the m1.large or m1.xlarge flavors. This is due to an insufficent quota definition for the acme_inc project.

0. Immediately upon launching the instance (virtual machine), it will begin spawning. How long the instance takes to spawn is completely dependent on how many resources the instance has been created with, and how the the underlying OpenStack architecture has been designed. Thankfully, the Alta3 Research datacenter is strapped with killer hardware, so it shouldn't take too long at all :p

0. Once the instance changes from 'Spawning' to 'Running', **sign out of the aliceanderson account**

0. Log in to Horizon as **`default:bobbarker:fa5tpa55w0rd`**

0. Click on **Project > Compute > Overview**

    > You should see the same total available resources that the account aliceanderson saw. Remember, both Alice and Bob are part of the same project (acme_inc)

0. **Click on Project > Compute > Instances**

    > You should still see the same instance that the account aliceanderson saw. Again, both Alice and Bob are part of the same project (acme_inc)

0. Logged in as bobbarker, **click on the 'Launch Instance' button**, then create the following instance:

    >
      **Details Tab**
    >
      Instance Name: acme_vm2
    >
      Availability Zone: nova
    >
      Count: 1
    >
      **Source**
    >
      Select Boot Source: Image (from drop down menu)
    >
      Create New Volume: No
    >
      Allocated: cirros (selections are made by pressing the + button, and removed by pressing the - button)
    >
      **Flavor**
    >
      Allocated: m1.tiny (selections are made by pressing the + button, and removed by pressing the - button)
    >
      **Networks**
    >
      Allocated: provider-net (selections are made by pressing the + button, and removed by pressing the - button)
    >
      **Network Ports**
    >
      (No changes)
    >
      **Security Groups**
    >
      (No changes)
    >
      **Key Pair**
    >
      (No changes)
    >
      **Configuration**
    >
      (No changes)
    >
      **Metadata**
    >
    (No changes)
    >

0. Once complete, **click the 'Launch' button**, and wait for the acme_vm2 instance to finish spawning (this should only take seconds).

0. Once acme_vm2 is running, **click on Project > Compute > Overview**

    > Spend a few minutes checking out this screen. Notice that no more instances or VCPUs are available for this project. It should look similar to the screen shot below:

    ![maxed out](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_create_VM_in_horizon_quota_max.png)
    
0. Would aliceanderson see the same statistics displayed on 'her' overview screen? Find out! Sign out or Horizon as **bobbarker** and sign back into horizon as **default:aliceanderson:fa5tpa55w0rd**

0. **Click on Project > Compute > Overview** and you'll see that the user aliceanderson has exactly the same overview screen as bobbarker! This is because they are both part of the same project.

0. Great job! That concludes this lab.
