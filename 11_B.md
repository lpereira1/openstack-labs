### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to create and work with groups. Groups are designed to manage access and assign roles to multiple members at once.

### Procedure

0. Back to the terminal. Time to create a group. Groups are created within a domain. Users can be added to groups. Roles can then be applied to groups, which are inherited by the users belonging to those groups. Let's create a group called `engineers` within the default domain.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack group create --domain default engineers`
    
0. Let's create a group called `technicians`.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack group create --domain default technicians`

0. We could pretend that maybe engineers have elevated permissions, where as technicians have permissions restricting them to only those activities relating to basic functions of VMs. Perhaps we want to make sure all engineers have the ability to
