### MONDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to teach students how to administer Aggregate Zones.


### Procedure

0. `Begin by clicking system/Host Aggregates/+Create Host Aggregate`
    ![Host Aggregrgate 1](https://alta3.com/labs/images/host_aggrate-lab_1.png)

0. Name the first host aggregate `host1` and name the asssociated Availability zone `az1`

0. Click  Manage Hosta with Aggregate

0. Click the `plus sign` next to compute1

0. click `Create Hot Aggregate`

0. Great, You created your first availability zone! Lets do that again.

0. Click on the `+Create Host Aggregate`
   ![Host Aggregrgate 2](https://alta3.com/labs/images/host_aggrate-lab_4.png)

0. Set the Name = `host2` and the Availability Zone = `az2`

0. click Manage Hosts with Aggregate

0. Click the `+` next to Compute2

0. Click `Create Host Aggregate`

0. OK, this lab is complete! You have not created two ***very*** simple availability zones, where each availability zone is constituted by one host (aka hypervisor). This can use this later to specifify the host on which an intance will be launched.

    In full sized clouds, an availability zone normally includes many hosts that have cerian pysical characteristics, like SSD hard drives for blazing fast ephemeral storage, or really fast networking, or perhaps even an oversubscribed availability zone that will not be fast but the price to run a machine will be much lower.
