### MONDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to teach students how to administer Host Aggregate and Availability Zones. Host aggregates can be regarded as a mechanism to further partition an availability zone; while availability zones are visible to users, host aggregates are only visible to administrators. Host aggregates started out as a way to use Xen hypervisor resource pools, but has been generalized to provide a mechanism to allow administrators to logically group together machines. Therefore, the admin might construct Host Aggregates to group together machines with the same power supply, same hypervisor type (XEN, ESXi, etc), all containing SSDs, and so on. The grouped Host Aggregates will then appear as Availablity Zones to your OpenStack users. 

### Procedure

0. To get started, open the Firefox browser within your remote desktop environment, and connect to (`http://controller/horizon`). **Sign into the OpenStack web GUI** with the creds **default:admin:alta3**

0. Click to **Admin > System > Host Aggregates**

0. Now click on the `+Create Host Aggregate` button. If you're lost, see the screenshot below to get caught up.

0. In the new popup, assign the following values within the first tab (Host Aggregate Information):
    - **Name:** `host1` 
    - **Availability Zone:** `az1`

0. Click the `Manage Hosts within Aggregate` tab

0. Click the `+` button next to **compute1**

0. Click the `Create Host Aggregate` button at the bottom of the window. see the screen show below if you are lost.

0. Great, You created your first availability zone! Lets do that again.

0. Click on the `+Create Host Aggregate` button.

0. In the new popup, assign the following values within the first tab (Host Aggregate Information):
    - **Name:** `host2` 
    - **Availability Zone:** `az2`

    ![Host Aggregrgate 2](https://alta3.com/labs/images/host_aggrate-lab_5.png)

0. Click the `Manage Hosts within Aggregate` tab

0. Click the `+` button next to **compute2**

0. Click `Create Host Aggregate`

0. OK, this lab is complete! You have not created two ***very*** simple availability zones, where each availability zone is constituted by one host (aka hypervisor). This can use this later to specifify the host on which an intance will be launched.

    >
    In full sized clouds, an availability zone normally includes many hosts that have cerian pysical characteristics, like SSD hard drives for blazing fast ephemeral storage, or really fast networking, or perhaps even an oversubscribed availability zone that will not be fast but the price to run a machine will be much lower. 

#### Additoinal Learning / References

The following is a list of resources we thought might be helpful to our students:

* [Amazon Web Services](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html) - "Each region contains multiple distinct locations called Availability Zones, or AZs. Each Availability Zone is engineered to be isolated from failures in other Availability Zones, and to provide inexpensive, low-latency network connectivity to other zones in the same region. By launching instances in separate Availability Zones, you can protect your applications from the failure of a single location.”
