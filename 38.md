### THURSDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to show students how to launch a Heat stack using a pre-written template.

### Procedure

0. From your remote desktop, open a terminal session, and move to the student home directory.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `ssh controller`

0. Confirm that the python-openstackclient is not currently installed. To be clear, the following command should fail.

    `student@controller:~$` `source admin.rc`

0. First, let's confirm that Heat is available. The following command should return an empty line.

    `student@beachhead (admin) :~$` `openstack stack list`

0. Okay, great. Now let's prepare to creat a stack. Retrieve the list of available flavors on your system (this is review).

    `student@beachhead (admin) :~$` `openstack flavor list`
    
0. Continuing to create our stack. Retrieve the list of available images on your system (this is review).

    `student@beachhead (admin) :~$` `openstack image list`
    
0. After we launch an instance with Heat, you'll want to be able to SSH into with a keypair. Let's produce a key just for use with our machines created with Heat (this is review).

    `student@beachhead (admin) :~$` `openstack keypair create heat_key > heat_key.priv`
    
0. Change the permissions on the key we created, so that it is usable.

    `student@beachhead (admin) :~$` `chmod 600 heat_key.priv`

0. We've already created a Heat template for use with this lab. Download it, and inspect it.

    `student@beachhead (admin) :~$` `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alta3/openstack-labs/no_wake_zone/heat_cirros.yaml`

0. Review the stack template, and then answer the following questions.

    `student@beachhead (admin) :~$` `cat heat_cirros.yaml`

0. Run the stack.
 
    `student@beachhead (admin) :~$` `openstack stack create -t heat_cirros.yaml --parameter key_name=heat_key teststack`
 
0. It failed. Why?
    
0. Run the new stack, this time, we will indicate with two new parameters the network and subnet we want to launch the instance on. This should fix our previous issue.

    `student@beachhead (admin) :~$` `openstack stack create -t heat_cirros.yaml --parameter key_name=heat_key --parameter network_name=provider-net teststack`

0. Examine the state of the launched stack.
 
    `student@beachhead (admin) :~$` `openstack stack event list teststack`

0. Log into Horizon as **admin**

0. Navigate to Project > Compute > Instances

0. Navigate to Project > Network > Network Topology

0. Navigate to Project > Orchestration > Stacks
    
0. Try to SSH to the new cirros VM.
 
    `student@beachhead (admin) :~$` `ssh -i heat_key.priv cirros@192.168.30.X`
