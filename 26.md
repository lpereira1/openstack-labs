### WEDNESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to use the Neutron service at the CLI. In this section, we'll create almost the same network as we created for acme_inc, only for a different tenant (vault_tek). This way you can compare and contrast the differences between working with the OpenStack Horizion dashboard and the CLI commands. At the conclusion of this lab, students should feel comfortable creating and modifying network settings using the python-openstackclient and python-neutronclient. It is worth noting, that some network commands still depend on using the python-neturonclient.

### Procedure

0. We don't need any old terminal windows open, so close them all, and then open a new one. Once you have a new terminal window open, SSH to controller. 

    `student@beachhead:/$` `ssh controller`

0. The CLI prompt should now read as follows:

    `student@controller:~$`

0. Source the chester.rc permissions file

    `student@controller :~$` `source chester.rc`
    
0. Create a vault-tek-network in the vault_tek project.

    `student@controller (chester) :~$` `openstack network create vault-tek-network`
    
      >
      If sucessful, details of the network will be shown.

0. Now create a vault-tek-network subnet

    `student@controller (chester) :~$` `neutron subnet-create --name vault-tek-network-subnet-10 --gateway 10.10.0.1 vault-tek-network 10.10.0.0/24`
    
      >
      NOTE: The command listed above line wraps, so be sure to include the second line as well, or an error stating "too few arguments" will occur.

    ```
Created a new subnet:

    `student@controller (chester) :~$` `neutron router-gateway-set vault-tek-router <UUID_OF_PROVIDER_NET>`
    >
    Set gateway for router vault-tek-router

0. Show the router using less with horizontal scrolling

    `student@controller (chester) :~$` `neutron router-show <ROUTER-ID> | less -S`

0. Connect the vault-tek-router to vault-tek-network-subnet-10

    `student@controller (chester) :~$` `neutron router-interface-add vault-tek-router vault-tek-network-subnet-10`

0. Check out the router now with the following command

    `student@controller (chester) :~$` `neutron router-show <ROUTER-ID>  | less -S`

0. Okay, I don't see the new interface, try this!

    `student@controller (chester) :~$` `neutron router-port-list <ROUTER-ID>`


    ```

    ```

0. Log into the OpenStack Horizon dashboard as **:default:chestercopperpot:fa5tpa55w0rd:**

0. Navigate to **Project > Network > Network Topology**

    ![Network Topo Vault Tek](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_horizon_network_topo_chester.png)

0. Navigate to **Project > Network > Networks**

    ![Network Not Shared](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_big_red_arrow.png)

    >
    Note that this network is not a shared network (see the big red arrow on the above screenshot), therefore it cannot be seen by other projects (tenants). Let's confirm this. 

0. Log out of the OpenStack Horizon dashboard, log back in as **:default:aliceanderson:fa5tpa55w0rd:**

0. As aliceanderson, navigate to **Project > Network > Networks**. You should no longer see vault-tek-network. This confirms that the network is indeed private.

0. Log back into the OpenStack Horizon dashboard as **:default:chestercopperpot:fa5tpa55w0rd:**

0. Navigate to **Project > Network > Routers**

0. Click on the router instance **vault-tek-router**. See the screenshot below if you are lost.

    ![Router Click](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_horizon_vt_router_click.png)

0. **IMPORTANT:** On the screen you are currently on, look for a value called "ID" which is highlighted blue in the figure below. **Write down the first 6 or so characters**. These will be helpful later.	

    ![Router ID](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_horizon_red_arrow.png)

0. Review the rest of the information being presented. Note that the router is connected to an "External Gateway" (provider-net). Now explore the **Overview** and **Interfaces** tabs.

0. Within the **Interfaces** tab, you will find a list of associated interfaces connected to the vault-tek-router. The screenshot below is what is displayed after clicking on the **Interfaces** tab.

    ![Interfaces Tab](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_horizon_network_router_interfaces_tab.png)
    
    >
    Note that this router has a fixed IP address (10.10.0.1), which connects it to the 10.10.0.0/24 network we just created.

0. Ok, we're done in Horizon for now, so back to the remote desktop terminal you should still have open. Let's launch a VM on the **vault-tek-network** and then SSH directly into it **without** applying a floating IP. To do this, we'll need to get a list of network UUIDs, then copy the UUID for provider-net.

    `student@controller (chester) :~$` `neutron net-list`
    
    ```
         +--------------------------------------+-------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
         | id                                   | name              | subnets                                            |
         +--------------------------------------+-------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    ---> | 42d302d3-a4e1-42d6-8ff9-bacda83e7e0b | vault-tek-network | 1d16ab92-7393-4877-b722-293cbb1209ef 10.10.0.0/24  |
         | b3b8d8f8-6668-48dc-b97e-db92be7c6fc7 | provider-net      | 571e4cd2-1b9d-4b05-9ee9-f23bc27451ae 172.16.2.0/24 |
         +--------------------------------------+-------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    ```

0. In the above output, there is an arrow pointing to the UUID we want (it is in the left column). You'll need to copy the one that was output to your screen, because it will be different than the one displayed in lab. With this UUID, customize the following command to boot a VM instance.

    `student@controller (chester) :~$` `openstack server create --image cirros --flavor m1.tiny --nic net-id=<UUID_OF_VAULT_TEK_FROM_PREVIOUS_COMMAND> --security-group http-ssh vt2`
 
0. This ouput display after you create a VM instance does not yet have an IP address assigned, so wait maybe 30 seconds (so the VM for sure has enough time to finish booting), and then run the following commands to display the newly created VMs assigned IP.

    `student@controller (chester) :~$` `nova show vt2`

	```

0. Look at the VERY bottom of the output. It should say, "vault-tek-network network" followed by an IP address formatted as 10.10.0.x **Write down this IP address**. It is likely something like 10.0.0.2, 10.0.0.3, 10.10.0.2, or 10.10.0.3.

    >
    **IMPORTANT:** If it says "provider-net", you launched the machine on the wrong network. Issue the *openstack server delete* command on the machine you just created and rebuild it. If this is unclear, ask the instructor for help.

0. Try to ping the private IP address supplied to vt2 on the vault-tek-network. This won't work, but just to be sure.

    `student@controller (chester) :~$` `ping 10.10.0.x`    

0. This command will go on indefinately, so press **CTRL** + **c** to quit the pinging process.

0. If you've been following along in the labs, you know that we could apply a floating IP address to the machine, and SSH to it. However, we want to explore a cool concept called *network namespaces*.

0. A *network namespaces* is a wildly advanced concept, but namespaces are ways to isolate processes within the Linux hypervisor itself. Issue the following command to see what network-namespaces exist.

    `student@controller (chester) :~$` `ip netns list`
 
    ```
qrouter-85a6b188-e6ee-4c81-b934-97ed2f054105 (id: 6)
qdhcp-42d302d3-a4e1-42d6-8ff9-bacda83e7e0b (id: 5)
qrouter-d7f8f401-65bd-4c67-b516-518729830be7 (id: 4)
qdhcp-04222c3d-0f8c-4f80-9220-b5572a3fc634 (id: 3)
qrouter-a8a2e5d7-2111-4ff9-9c5a-26fe2c9ef0c0 (id: 2)
qdhcp-3cf2556b-405a-4a84-9435-c5dd9246880b (id: 1)
qdhcp-b3b8d8f8-6668-48dc-b97e-db92be7c6fc7 (id: 0)
    ```
 
0. Your list will be unique, however, look near the top of the output from the *ip netns list* command. We're looking for a match that begins **qrouter-** and followed by the same characters you recorded back in Horizon when we examed the vault-tek-router. See the screenshot below if you're confused as to the assocation we're trying to make.

    ![Interfaces Tab](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_horizon_netns.png)

0. Highlight the UUID value, include the word *qrouter*, but do not include the (id: x) portion. Right click, and copy that value. Look at the screenshot below if you are confused.

    ![Interfaces Tab](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_horizon_copy_ns.png)

0. Now we're going to tell Ubuntu to allow us access to access that router's namespace. After we're in the namespace, we'll have SSH access to the VM we just created (vt2). If it works, you'll be prompted to log into the VM instance.

0. **IMPORTANT:** For the next step to be successful, you MUST replace \<PASTE_THE_NAMESPACE_HERE\> (including the \<\>) with the *qrouter*-UUID pair you copied from above. You also must replace \<IP_ADDRESS_OF_VT2\> with the IP adress of vt2 (same one you tried to ping a little bit ago, begins 10.10.0.x).

    `student@controller (chester) :~$` `sudo ip netns exec <PASTE_THE_NAMESPACE_HERE> ssh cirros@<IP_ADDRESS_OF_VT2>`
	
	> EXAMPLE ONLY: ip netns exec qrouter-b1579da2-d5a4-40ec-b6a5-606413f1738e ssh cirros@10.10.0.3
	- **NOTE 3:** The username and password for all cirros machines is **cirros** and **cubswin:)** by default. Don't forget the smiley!

0. There you go! If it worked, you'll be inside of the little cirros VM you just created!

0. There isn't much to see inside of a CirrOS VM, so once your curiosity is satisfied, type the following to return to controller. 

    `$` `exit`

0. Close your SSH session to controller.

    `student@controller (chester) :~$` `exit`

0. Close your SSH session to beachhead.

    `student@beachhead:\$` `exit`
