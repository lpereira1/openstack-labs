### MONDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

Let's role play a bit. Your new OpenStack deployment has gone live and you are ready to take on your first customers. These may be paying customers or perhaps a particular department within your organization.

   - **Order 1:** Acme Inc would like two users, Alice Anderson, and Bob Barker, to be able to admin a small cloud for their company.

Our first order will be provisioned via Horizon as the admin user. We'll start out signed into the system as the admin for the OpenStack deployment. You would never want to give this account out to your customers, but it is the account we need to use in order to create a new project (and eventually apply some users to that project).

Users may belong to many projects, but they always must belong to at least one. If a user belongs to a project, and that project is deleted, then that user will not be able to log into the Horizon dashboard until they are once again assigned to (at least) one project.

Before we create new users, lets first create a few projects (tenants).

### Procedure

0. Log in as admin to the Horizon interface, and **navigate to Identity > Projects**.

0. In the upper right hand corner, **click the '+Create Project' button**. See the screen shot below if you're lost.

    ![create project](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_02_b_create_project.png)

0. On the Project Information tab, **input the following Project Information**

    ``` 
    Name: acme_inc
    Description: Acme Inc. is the world's leader in the production of widgets 
    Enabled: (checked)
    ```

    ![project details](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_02_b_project_details.png)

0. **Click on the 'Project Members' tab.** We don't yet have any users from the Acme Inc organization, so we won't apply any yet.

0. **Click on the 'Project Groups' tab.** We don't yet have any groups from the Acme Inc. organization, so we won't apply any yet.

0. Now **click on the 'Quota' tab**

    > This page controls the operational limits of a project could place on available resources within our infrastructure. For example, we certainly don't want our customer, Acme Inc, to max out our cloud's storage space with widget designs.

0. Let's set an appropriate quota: 

    `Metadata Items: 128`
	
    > When booting an instance, you can also add arbitrary meta data so that you can more easily identify it among other running instances. This value limits the length of the string, where 128 characters is the default .

    `VCPUs: 2`
	
    > VCPUs are the number of available virtualized cores (not physical cores)

    `Instances: 2` 
	
    > The number of instances, or VMs, that maybe created by the project
    
    `Injected Files: 5`

    > Injected files are arbitrary local files that can be placed into the instance file system at the time of creation. 

    `Injected File Content (Bytes): 10240`

    > Limits total size (in bytes) of allowable injected files.

    `Volumes: 2`

    `Volume-Snapshots: 2`
    
    `Total-Size-of-Volumes-and-Snapshots-(GB): 200`
    
    > Total accrued size of all stored data. 
    
    `RAM-(MB): 12800`

    `Security-Groups: 5`

    > The total available security groups this project may create

    `Security-Group-Rules: 20`

    > The total available security group rules this project may create
   
    `Floating-IPs: 4`
   
    > Total number of floating IP addresses the project may utilize. Floating IPs are applied to instances.
   
    `Networks: 3`
   
    > Number of virtualized networks that may be created
   
    `Ports: 50`
   
    `Routers: 3`
   
    `Subnets: 3`
   
    > Maximum number of subnets that may be created by a project.

0. You are now permitted to **click the Create Project button**. If this is successful, Horizon will display the acme_inc project, as shown below.

0. Great job! That is it for this lab.
