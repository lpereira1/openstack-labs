### WEDNESDAY - &#x2B50;OPTIONAL&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to teach a deep dive of neutron network.

### Procedure

0. Close any old terminals you might have open on your remote desktop environment.

0. We can watch the results of the command line in Horizon. This is very instructional, so within your remote dekstop, sign into Horizon as **:default:admin:alta3:**

0. Click on **Project > Network > Network Topology**.

0. Study what is being presented. You can left click on the icons, and little pop-ups will show up explaining those icons in detail. The **provider-net**, **demo-net**, and **demorouter** were set up (by Alta3) for the admin project before you entered class. If you need help figuring out what is being presented to you, check the screenshot below.

    ![Virtual Networking](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_lab_horizon_network_topology.png)

0. Leave the Horizon session open so you can see it. Meanwhile, launch a new terminal session on your remote desktop, then connect to controller.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `ssh controller`
    
0. Source the admin.rc file

    `student@controller:~$` `source admin.rc`

0. All instances must be deleted, so list all running instances and delete them all.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack server list --all-projects`  

    ```
    +--------------------------------------+--------+--------+--------------------------+
    | ID                                   | Name   | Status | Networks                 |
    +--------------------------------------+--------+--------+--------------------------+
    | 8bd0d720-4053-4a36-a243-4b8edca76c3a | vt1    | ACTIVE | provider-net=172.16.2.57 |
    +--------------------------------------+--------+--------+--------------------------+
    ```
    >
    Just an FYI, if you ever get machines showing up in an "ERROR" status, they can be tough to delete. This can happen for a number of reasons, but should not happen by design. See the following thread for some helpful commands you might issue via the openstack-novaclient (https://ask.openstack.org/en/question/50410/nova-cannot-boot-or-delete-image/). If you do have a VM with a state of "ERROR", let the instructor know.
   
0. If you made some additional instances, you might see more. If you already deleted vt1, you'll see less. In any event, issue the following command against each virtual machinE'S uuid that was returned in the ID column of the last step.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack server delete <UUID_listed_in_ID_column>`

0. Ask again for a display of all the running instances in the cloud. Nothing should be returned.
    >
    Just another FYI for anyone that has a VM in an "ERROR" status. This lab won't work if the VM is still holding an IP address on provider-net. If that is the case, look at the link above in the last step, and try to force delete the machine.
    
    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack server list --all-projects`  

    ```
    +--------------------------------------+--------+--------+--------------------------+
    | ID                                   | Name   | Status | Networks                 |
    +--------------------------------------+--------+--------+--------------------------+
    +--------------------------------------+--------+--------+--------------------------+
    ```

0. Great! Now we can move on to removing all of that networking.

0. We're admin, so we can ask neutron to discover all routers that must be deleted.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `neutron router-list --max-width 60`

    ```
Your output should look something like this:
+--------------------------------------+------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+-------------+-------+
| id                                   | name       | external_gateway_info                                        | distributed | ha    |

|                                      |            | "enable_snat": true, "external_fixed_ips": [{"subnet_id":    |             |       |

|                                      |            | "172.16.2.51"}]}                                             |             |       |
+--------------------------------------+------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+-------------+-------+
    ```

0. List all available subnets.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `neutron subnet-list` 
 
    ```
Your output should look something like this:
+--------------------------------------+-----------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| id                                   | name            | cidr            | allocation_pools                                   |
+--------------------------------------+-----------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| 571e4cd2-1b9d-4b05-9ee9-f23bc27451ae | provider-subnet | 172.16.2.0/24   | {"start": "172.16.2.50", "end": "172.16.2.250"}    |
| f2a50b9e-6ba8-4d74-8efa-ea256b253254 | demo-net_subnet | 192.168.30.0/24 | {"start": "192.168.30.2", "end": "192.168.30.254"} |
+--------------------------------------+-----------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    ```

0. Now we need to delete all of the preconfigured aspects of networking. The graphic below depicts the order (A through F) that we'll remove this prebuilt virtual network.

    ![Trash the Neutron Preconfiguration](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_lab_delete_network_order.png)

0. Delete the interface on the router called demo-net_subnet (See step A in the graphic above)
    
    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `neutron router-interface-delete demorouter demo-net_subnet`

0. Delete the router demorouter (See step B in the graphic above)

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `neutron router-delete demorouter provider-subnet`    

0. Delete the subnet demo-net_subnet (See step C in the graphic above)

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `neutron subnet-delete demo-net_subnet`

0. Delete the network demo-net (See step D in the graphic above)

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `neutron net-delete demo-net`

0. Delete the subnet provider-net (See step E in the graphic above)

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `neutron subnet-delete provider-subnet`

0. Delete the network provider (See step F in the graphic above)

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `neutron net-delete provider-net`

0. Congradulations! Now you now have the machine looking the way it did when neturon was originally deployed. All of the demonstration configuration has been removed. Now let's put it all back, step-by-step...

0. For your information, neutron is running on your controller. Controller has two (2) NICs, connected to two subnets, both connecting to the internet. These are defined as follows:

    >
    Admin network: 172.16.1.0/24
    
    >
    Provider network: 172.16.2.0/24

0. So, which NIC is assigned to the admin network, and which is assigned to the provider network? We can find this out by issuing the following command to list details regarding these two NICs within our controller:

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `ip addr`

    ```
  1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1
      link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
      inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
         valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
      inet6 ::1/128 scope host
        valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
  2: ens3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1450 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000
      link/ether fa:16:3e:2f:61:74 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
      inet 172.16.1.5/24 brd 172.16.1.255 scope global ens3  
         valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
      inet6 fe80::f816:3eff:fe2f:6174/64 scope link
         valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
  3: ens4: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000 
      link/ether fa:16:3e:be:52:55 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
      inet6 fe80::f816:3eff:febe:5255/64 scope link   
         valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever  
    ```

0. The ens3 is assiged to the admin network by virtue of its ip address 172.16.1.5/24, which is the physical administration network. So is "ens4" the Provider NIC? Let's find out for sure. We will follow a two-step process. So first you must discover which mechanism_driver is specified in ml2_conf.ini. The egrep filter skips the comments, listing only the configuration:

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `student@controller (admin) :~$` `cat  /etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini | egrep -v "(^#.*|^$)"`

    ```
[DEFAULT]
[ml2]
type_drivers = flat,vlan,vxlan
tenant_network_types = vxlan
mechanism_drivers = linuxbridge,l2population
extension_drivers = port_security
[ml2_type_flat]
flat_networks = provider
[ml2_type_geneve]
[ml2_type_gre]
[ml2_type_vlan]
[ml2_type_vxlan]
vni_ranges = 1:1000
[securitygroup]
enable_ipset = true
    ```
    >
    Looks like the mechanism_drivers = linuxbridge,l2population  

0. So now lets look for the NIC that is associated with the linuxbridge

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `cat  /etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/linuxbridge_agent.ini | egrep -v "(^#.*|^$)"`

    ```
[DEFAULT]
[agent]
[linux_bridge]
physical_interface_mappings = provider:ens4
[securitygroup]
firewall_driver = neutron.agent.linux.iptables_firewall.IptablesFirewallDriver
enable_security_group = true
[vxlan]
enable_vxlan = true
local_ip = 172.16.1.5
l2_population = true
    ```

    >
    We see `physical_interface_mappings = provider:ens4`. This means the physical network interface is called "provider" and is mapped to "ens4". Some cloud operators call this "external", "public", or "fabric", so your network may use a different name here.

0. Now associate the physical interface to the provider network, with a network name "provider-net"

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `neutron net-create --shared --provider:physical_network provider --provider:network_type flat provider-net`

0. So what changed on our network virtualization diagram? The answer is nothing so far. We would see a database entry if we looking into the Neutron database, but nothing else. If the inner-scientist is you is screaming, emprirical evidence needed, we already like you, so check it out if you need proof, the commands `ip link show` , `brctl show` , and `ip netns` will show no changes. s

0. Define a new subnet, called provider-subnet" and assign it to "provider-net"   

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `neutron subnet-create --name provider-subnet  --allocation-pool start=172.16.2.50,end=172.16.2.250 --dns-nameserver 10.3.200.1  --gateway 172.16.2.1 provider-net 172.16.2.0/24`  

0. OK, lets check out what changed. We use the command  
    `student@controller (admin) :~$`  `ip link show`
  
    ```
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1

13: brq27928fa3-e3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether c2:59:27:e1:d4:6d brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

    ```
    > We see two new links 12 and 13. This example shows: `tap1fde8ad0-81@if2` and `brq27928fa3-e3`. Your exact name will vary, but what you see in your controller will be very similar to this. 


0. Check out that new bridge with the linux `brctl show` command, using the following as an EXAMPLE (Use YOUR bridge ID, not mine!:  
  `student@controller (admin) :~$`  `brctl show brq27928fa3-e3`

    ```
bridge name     bridge id               STP enabled     interfaces
brq27928fa3-e3          8000.c25927e1d46d       no              ens4
                                                        tap1fde8ad0-81
    ```
0. Wow, that output above is not pretty, so here is that same output in a table. We quickly notice that this bridge has two interfaces, the `ens4` physical interface and the `tap1fde8ad0-81`, which is missing the `@if2` ***suffix***. 

    ```
|bridge name|bridge id|STP enabled|interfaces
|---|---|---|---|
|brq27928fa3-e3| 8000.c25927e1d46d| no| ens4
|||     |                       tap1fde8ad0-81
    ```


0. Be aware that the `tap1fde8ad0-81` is a ***veth*** termination. We know one end of this veth terminates in bridge `brq27928fa3-e3`, to find the other end of the veth, we can use ethtool as follows: (Make sure you do NOT include the `@if2` suffix:  
   
    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `ethtool -S tap8a7c064a-f3`

    ```
NIC statistics:
     peer_ifindex: 2
    ```

   >***peer_ifindex*** references the same link numbers that `ip link show` displays, therefore, this veth terminates in ip link number 2. We know that link 2 (according to ip link list) is the physical interface ens3. Congratualtions, assuming that you just traced your first veth!

0. Now lets see if any network namespcaces were created. We need to use the sudo command for this, so if you do not have sudo priveleges, here are the results:  

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `ip netns`

    ```
qdhcp-27928fa3-e3d8-4942-968b-75ead0ba8f33 (id: 0)
    ```

0. Inside the qhdcp (quantum DHCP) namespace is a seperate universe of linux networking logic, interfaces, ip tables, bridges, taps, and yes, even DHCP! In order to connect a namespace to the outside world, a veth is required. Let's see if we can trace the veth into the qdhcp namespace. The following command executes `ip link show` inside the qhdcp namespace: 

   `sudo ip netns exec qdhcp-27928fa3-e3d8-4942-968b-75ead0ba8f33 ip link show`

    ```
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: ns-1fde8ad0-81@if12: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether fa:16:3e:e2:34:33 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
    ```  
    > So there are two interfaces inside the qdhcp namespace. One is a loopback, the other looks like a veth, judging from the naming convention which includes an `@if12` suffix


2. So lets track that veth tap with the conspicipus `@if12` suffix.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `sudo ip netns exec qdhcp-27928fa3-e3d8-4942-968b-75ead0ba8f33 ethtool -S  ns-1fde8ad0-81`

    ```
1fde8ad0-81
NIC statistics:
     peer_ifindex: 12
    ```

3. Analyze this diagram which shows the connectivity you current have established.  
 ![provider-net_subnet](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_lab_provider-subnet.png)  

4. Create a new subnet, seperate from the provider net. Call it "demo-net"  
  `student@controller (admin) :~$` `neutron net-create demo-net`    
  > No analysis is necessary here because all this command did was to create a database entry.

5. Create a new subnet called demo-net_subnet and assign demo-net_subnet to demo-net  

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `neutron subnet-create --name demo-net_subnet --dns-nameserver 10.3.200.1 --gateway 192.168.30.1 demo-net 192.168.30.0/24`  
    
0. Let's discover newly create netwok functions:  
    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `ip link show`

    > There are three new interfaces: (Reference the listing earlier in this lab for interfaces 1 - 13)

    ```
14: tap8e72ee18-51@if2: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1450 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether be:8e:63:47:49:7d brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 1
15: vxlan-34: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1400 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether d6:91:17:21:ed:c2 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
16: brq43f3c344-e9: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1400 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether be:8e:63:47:49:7d brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    ```

0. Let's see where the link 14 tap leads:  
    
    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `ethtool -S tap8e72ee18-51`
   
    ```  
NIC statistics:
     peer_ifindex: 2
    ```
  
    > This veth connects to link 2, so the `@if2` suffix appears to be a reliable indicator.

0. `student@controller (admin) :~$` ` brctl show`

    ```
bridge name     bridge id               STP enabled     interfaces
brq27928fa3-e3          8000.c25927e1d46d       no              ens4
                                                        tap1fde8ad0-81
brq43f3c344-e9          8000.be8e6347497d       no              tap8e72ee18-51
                                                        vxlan-34

    ```
Lets put this in a table for easier reading:

    ```
|bridge name|bridge id|STP enabled|interfaces|
|---|---|---|---|
|brq27928fa3-e3|8000.c25927e1d46d|no|ens4|
| | | |tap1fde8ad0-81
|brq43f3c344-e9|8000.be8e6347497d|no|tap8e72ee18-51|
|||| vxlan-34|
    ```
    
    >
    So there are two bridges now, the second bridge with two ports
    >
    1. tap
    >
    2. vxlan interface


0. Let's check out the vxlan info:  

    `student@controller (admin) :~$ ` `bridge fdb show dev vxlan-34`

    ```
15: vxlan-34: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1400 qdisc noqueue master brq43f3c344-e9 state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether d6:91:17:21:ed:c2 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff promiscuity 1
    vxlan id 34 dev ens3 srcport 0 0 dstport 8472 ageing 300
    bridge_slave state forwarding priority 32 cost 100 hairpin off guard off root_block off fastleave off learning on flood on addrgenmode eui64
    ```

0. Now lets check out the vxlan-34 device's forwarding rules:  
   `student@controller (admin) :~$` `bridge fdb show dev vxlan-34`

```
d6:91:17:21:ed:c2 vlan 1 master brq43f3c344-e9 permanent
d6:91:17:21:ed:c2 master brq43f3c344-e9 permanent
```

0. Are there any new namespaces?   
   `student@controller (admin) :~$` `ip netns`

    ```
qdhcp-43f3c344-e9e7-4343-903e-206b9c9b747d (id: 1)  {demo-net}
qdhcp-27928fa3-e3d8-4942-968b-75ead0ba8f33 (id: 0)  {provider-net} 
    ```

    >
    So there is a new veth-connected qdhcp namespace. A quick look with `sudo ip netns exec qdhcp-43f3c344-e9e7-4343-903e-206b9c9b747d ip link` displays the following, indicating a new veth connected DHCP server for demo-net.
    
    ```

0. Lets change our drawing to show the new NFV devices

    ![provider-net_subnet](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_lab_add_demo_subnet.png) 

0. Make the provider-net network the service provider. No further analysis on this step. 
    
    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `neutron net-update provider-net --router:external`

0. Create a virtual router called **demorouter**. No further analysis on this step.
    
    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `neutron router-create demorouter`

0. Connect demorouter to demo-net_subnet  
    
    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `neutron router-interface-add demorouter demo-net_subnet`
    
0. Let's see if this created a new network namespace:
  
    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `ip netns`
    
    ```
    qrouter-cd340cfa-ee59-46e8-8b65-1c0889c0a1a1 (id: 2)
    qdhcp-43f3c344-e9e7-4343-903e-206b9c9b747d (id: 1)
    qdhcp-27928fa3-e3d8-4942-968b-75ead0ba8f33 (id: 0)
    ```
    >
    So there is definately a new namespace here. Let's see what is inside!
    >
    We run `sudo ip netns exec qrouter-cd340cfa-ee59-46e8-8b65-1c0889c0a1a1 ip link` and observe the following output:
  
    ```
    1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    2: qr-7e514faa-56@if17: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1450 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether fa:16:3e:b4:87:16 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0

    >
    So there is a veth connection this qrouter namespace to link #17.


0. Let's see if there are any new interfaces:  
    
    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `ip link`

    ```
    17: tap7e514faa-56@if2: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1400 qdisc noqueue master brq43f3c344-e9 state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether a6:68:17:3f:ed:16 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 2
    ```
    
    >
    So there is a new tap interface, which uses a veth to connect to Link #2.

0. lets add the LAST INTERFACE, connecting demorouter to povider-net.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `neutron router-gateway-set demorouter provider-net`

0. If we take a look inside the qrouter namespace one more time, we will see a new veth by running the command

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `sudo ip netns exec qrouter-cd340cfa-ee59-46e8-8b65-1c0889c0a1a1 ip link`. 

    ```
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: qr-7e514faa-56@if17: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1450 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether fa:16:3e:b4:87:16 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
3: qg-16f8ed57-86@if18: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether fa:16:3e:fa:b3:d4 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
    ```

0. Lastly, let's check and see if there are any new interfaces:
   
   `student@controller (admin) :~$` `ip link show`
   
   ```
   18: tap16f8ed57-86@if3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue master brq27928fa3-e3 state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether da:e4:82:63:d7:c3 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 2 
   ```
   >
   So there is a new tap, that is connected by a veth to link #3

0. Congratulations, you finished! Now let's roll all that up into a diagram and analyze the results

    Just is case you are wondering why there is no further activity in compute1, that will change quickly if you boot an instance on compute node 1.
