### Lab 00 - Student Setup - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

Welcome to the Alta3 OpenStack Labs! Before we get started, let's review some basics:

Each lab is structured with a Title, Lab Objective, and the Procedure.

   - Title - Indicates if this lab is Required, Optional (Basic), or Optional (Advanced)
      - **Required** - Marked with a Gold Star emoji. Everyone must do these labs! These labs build on one another, so don't skip any!
      - **Optional (Basic)** - Marked with a Hammer emoji. Do these labs if you are new to Linux or the Command Line Interface.
      - **Optional (Advanced)** - Marked with a Rocket Ship emoji. Do these labs if you're a Rocket Scientist and are looking for more than just the basics (i.e. "You're a wizard Harry")
   - Lab Objective - The ultimate goal of the procedure.
   - Procedure - Numbered steps to follow.

The objective of this lab is to instruct students on how to access their lab environment from a Windows, Linux, or Apple platform. All you will need to perform the labs is a browser. The flavor of the browser is upto you, but if you have any issues, please switch to Google Chrome.

### Procedure

0. Here is your OpenStack lab environment: 

	![Lab Environment](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3-cloud-nets-001.png)

0. While **holding down the control key**, click the following link to gain access to your remote desktop "beachhead". https://alta3.com/beachhead
    
0. If your default browser is Chrome or firefox, while **holding down the control key**, click: https://alta3.com/sshproxy to connect to your SSH proxy. If your default browser is IE, then cut and paste `https://alta3.com/sshproxy` into a new chrome or firefox browser window.
 
0. Answer the following questions to confirm that you understand the lab environment:
    - **Q1: How many browser tabs will you have open to do these labs?**
      - A1: Three. One for the lab manual (https://alta3.com/labs/openstack), one for terminal access (https://alta3.com/sshproxy), and one for Horion (https://**LAST_NAME**.alta3.training)
    - **Q2: When you are asked to connect via command line, will everyone use the same URL?  If so, what is it?**
      - Q2: Yes. Everyone will use (https://alta3.com/sshproxy) as a 'hop of point' into the CLI of their own controller.
    - **Q3: When you connect to OpenStack Horizon, what URL will you browse? (Hint, find your name on the table above)**
      - Q3: The OpenStack Horizon Dashboard is available via (https://**YOUR_LAST_NAME_HERE**.alta3.training)
    - **Q4: How many nodes are in your OpenStack lab environment?**
      - Q4: Four - Controller, Networking, Compute1, and Compute2
    - **Q5: Where will VMs run?**
      - Q5: VMs will always run on compute nodes, never on the Controller or Networking nodes.
