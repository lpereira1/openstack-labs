## Lab XY - Edit the Horizon Log-In Timeout Setting - &#x1F680;OPTIONAL&#x1F680; - MONDAY

### Lab Objective

Now that Alice Anderson and Bob Barker have been added to the project space Acme Inc, we want to sign in as those users and confirm that they can launch instances (create infastructure). The marketing department would call this, "Infastructure As A Service", and is the product Acme Inc is paying us for.

### Procedure

0. Session timeout setting
    > If the 2 minute timeout is annoyingly short, you can change the Openstack timeout following this suggestion: https://ask.openstack.org/en/question/32206/horizon-session-timeout/

    > **SESSION_TIMEOUT**- This SESSION_TIMEOUT is a method to supercede the token timeout with a shorter horizon session timeout (in seconds). So if your token expires in 60 minutes, a value of 1800 will log users out after 30 minutes.
