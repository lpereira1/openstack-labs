# Lab 16 - CLI OpenStack RC files

### TUESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

Setting flags on every CLI command involves far too much typing. Let's make our commands easier to issue by setting some environmental variables for our current bash session by creating **RC** files. If environmental vs shell variables, and parent vs child sessions are new terms for you, that is OK. There is a small OPTIONAL lab coming up that will make it more clear.

Every Linux distro names their files a little differently: openstackrc, openstackrc.sh, adminrc.sh, admin.rc. As long as you understand what an **RC** file does, you don't need to get hung up on naming conventions.

Some quick history... In the old Unix days, the runcom files on the CTSS system (1962-63), were fed into the machine via a startup script /etc/rc. This script file contained startup instructions for an application program (or an entire operating system). It was usually a text file containing commands that might have been invoked manually once the system was running, but instead, are to be executed automatically each time the system starts up. So, for those that may have been curious, rc stands for *runcom* or *run commands*.

### Procedure

0. We don't need any old terminal windows open, so close them all, and then open a new one. Once you have a new terminal window open, SSH to controller. 

    `student@beachhead:/$` `ssh controller`

0. The CLI prompt should now read as follows:

    `student@controller:~$`

0. So an RC file containing admin privledges called *admin.rc* has already been created for you in the home directory. These are not created automatically, you **must** be able to create them for yourself if you're going to be become proficient at the CLI. Display the contents of the `admin.rc` file

    `student@controller:~$` `cat admin.rc`

    > Comments have been added to the output, your output will lack the comments (lines that begin with #).

    ```
    # Sets an environmental variable for the user's project domain as default
    export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME=default
    # Sets an environmental variable for the user's domain name as default
    export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=default
    # Sets an environmental variable for user's project name as admin
    export OS_PROJECT_NAME=admin
    # Sets an environmental variable for user name as admin    
    export OS_USERNAME=admin
    # Sets an environmental variable as the password alta3
    export OS_PASSWORD=alta3
    # Sets an environmental variable for Keystone's RESTful API socket for admin requests
    export OS_AUTH_URL=http://controller:35357/v3
    # Sets an environmental variable for identity RESTful API version as 3    
    export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3
    # Sets an environmental variable for the image RESTful API version as 2
    export OS_IMAGE_API_VERSION=2
    # Appends the CLI prompt with (admin) and applies color
    export PS1="\[\e[33m\]\u\[\e[m\]@\[\e[36m\]\h\[\e[m\] (\[\e[35m\]admin\[\e[m\]) :\W\$ "
    ```
    
    >
    Essentially, we can set all of our credentials in this file, source this file, and then not have to ever type our credentials again as they'll always be available to the bash environment.
    >
    >
    NOTE: The name of this file may change slightly depending on your environment. RDO deployments use the formatting structure keystonerc_$USER

0. Display a list of the environmental variables currently set

    `student@controller:~$` `printenv`
    
    > Look over the displayed entries. Do you see any mention of the aforementioned credentials, such as `OS_PROJECT_NAME` or `OS_USERNAME`?

0. So it doesn't look like any environmental variables containing OS have been set, but try that command again. This time, pass a grep command to say you're specifically searching for any environmental variables that begin with OS_

    `student@controller:~$` `printenv | grep OS_`
   
    > Still, nothing is returned.

0. Okay, so now set the environmental variables found in **admin.rc**

    `student@controller:~$` `source admin.rc`
       
    >
    **source** is a bash shell built-in command that executes the content of the file passed as a argument in the current shell. It is synonymous with ' . ' (period).
    >
    After executing the above command, the CLI line will change. This is just a reminder that you are now passing commands to the OpenStack services as some user (in this case admin).
 
0. Once again, display a list of the environmental variables currently set.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `printenv | grep OS_`
    
    >
    Look over the displayed entries. Now you will see a listing for the variables contained within `admin.rc`, such as `OS_PROJECT_NAME` and `OS_USERNAME`.

    ```
   OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=default
   OS_IMAGE_API_VERSION=2
   OS_PROJECT_NAME=admin
   OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3
   OS_PASSWORD=alta3
   OS_AUTH_URL=http://controller:35357/v3
   OS_USERNAME=admin
   OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME=default
    ```
    >
    Just for your understanding, these entries are only set for this current bash session. If you close this bash shell, then open a new terminal, these variables will unset themselves.

0. Flex your new admin environmental-variable-given powers 

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack flavor list`
    
    > This time it should just work without having to type the extra permissions. Try executing a few more commands to the other OpenStack services as well.

0. Issue a few more commands that should make it clear, you are now 'signed in' to the CLI as admin. First, let's create a project called temp_project. Only an admin can create projects.
	
    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack project create temp_project --domain default`

0. Confirm that temp_project was actually created.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack project list`

0. Retrieve a list of openstack users.
    
    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack user list`

    ```

0. Answer the following question:
  - **Q1: What OpenStack service did we just invoke to create a new project and a user?**
    - A1: Keystone
	
0. Remember our buddy chestercopperpot of vault_tek? You should have seen him when you issued the previous command **openstack user list**. Let's make it easy for us to execute OpenStack commands as chestercopperpot who is part of the project `vault_tek` at the CLI.


0. Look at the user chestercopperpot, and note the UUID of his default_project_id

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack user show chestercopperpot`

    ```
    +--------------------+----------------------------------+
    | Field              | Value                            |
    +--------------------+----------------------------------+
    | default_project_id | 6417af4dea224c5999e89a7634d27645 | <-- LOOK AT THIS UUID! THIS IS <DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID>!
    | domain_id          | f7fec41f3beb41d29896c6aeb2c34b58 |
    | email              | chester@vaulttek.com             |
    | enabled            | True                             |
    | id                 | bbd00ac0ce7c410198ffcac13d26932c |
    | name               | chestercopperpot                 |
    +--------------------+----------------------------------+
    ```
	
0. Associate the tenant name with the UUID of chestercopperpot's default_project_id with the id below (it should be vault_tek).
   
    `student@controller (admin) :~$`  `openstack project list`

    ```
         +----------------------------------+---------------+
         | ID                               | Name          |
         +----------------------------------+---------------+
         | 1bc66b9ab9a24814bba5438d2db74147 | admin         |
         | 3912a08ca34f4507a078198e0227a5da | acme_inc      |
         | 431ce679d770497e90c308e58c32de0b | alta3         |
         | 4859363384de40b3b3bb152fefbee9ae | demo          |
         | 4cf5d4b5259b47038a3ed04b836717a4 | temp_project  |
    ---> | 6417af4dea224c5999e89a7634d27645 | vault_tek     | <-- Should match chestercopperpot's <DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID> from above!
         | 712e8501dd204df188c64f44bd81093d | service       |
         +----------------------------------+---------------+
    ```

0. Often times the python-clients require using UUIDs. By design, these are unique on every system, so you will need to occasionally customize a command. In the next command, you need to replace \*\*\<DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID\>\*\* with the value you retrieved in the last step when you issued *openstack project list*.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$`  `openstack project show **<DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID>**`
    
    >
    Just as an example, the value the lab examples would use is:
    >
    *openstack project show 6417af4dea224c5999e89a7634d27645*


    ```
    +-------------+----------------------------------+
    | Field       | Value                            |
    +-------------+----------------------------------+
    | description |                                  |
    | domain_id   | f7fec41f3beb41d29896c6aeb2c34b58 |
    | enabled     | True                             |
    | id          | 6417af4dea224c5999e89a7634d27645 |
    | is_domain   | False                            |
    | name        | vault_tek                        |
    | parent_id   | f7fec41f3beb41d29896c6aeb2c34b58 |
    +-------------+----------------------------------+
    ```

0. Alternatively the name vault_tek could also be used, but ideally it is best to get in the habit of working the UUIDs within an Openstack environment.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$`  `openstack project show vault_tek`

    ```
             +-------------+----------------------------------+
             | Field       | Value                            |
             +-------------+----------------------------------+
             | description |                                  |
             | domain_id   | f7fec41f3beb41d29896c6aeb2c34b58 |
             | enabled     | True                             |
        ---> | id          | 6417af4dea224c5999e89a7634d27645 |
             | is_domain   | False                            |
             | name        | vault_tek                        |
             | parent_id   | f7fec41f3beb41d29896c6aeb2c34b58 |
             +-------------+----------------------------------+
    ```

0. Let's make an rc file for chestercopperpot! Start by issuing the following command to open vim.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `vim chester.rc`

0. Edit **chester.rc** so it looks like the following (copy and paste is fine):

    <pre>
    export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME=default
    export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=default
    export OS_PROJECT_NAME=vault_tek
    export OS_USERNAME=chestercopperpot
    export OS_PASSWORD=fa5tpa55w0rd
    export OS_AUTH_URL=http://controller:5000/v3
    export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3
    export OS_IMAGE_API_VERSION=2
    export PS1="\[\e[33m\]\u\[\e[m\]@\[\e[36m\]\h\[\e[m\] (\[\e[35m\]chester\[\e[m\]) :\W\$ "
    </pre>

	> **Vim hints:**  
         To start editing changes, do the following:
	 press i (to enter --INSERT-- mode)  
	 To move cursor around:
	 Use up, down, left, right arrows on the keyboard
	 Top stop editing, do the following:
	 press ESC (to enter command mode)
	 To save and quit, do the following:
	 press SHIFT + : (to issues commands)  
	 press wq (to writeout and quit), and press ENTER to confirm.
	 To quit without saving, do the following:
	 press SHIFT + : (to issues commands)  
	 press press q! (to quit), and press ENTER to confirm.
 
0. After you save the file and quit, display the contents of **chester.rc** and verify that they are correct.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `cat chester.rc`

0. Set global variables in the current shell to correspond with the user chestercopperpot.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `source chester.rc`
 
0.  Check the results... notice anything that begins OS_ is now a reflection of values pertaining to the user chestercopperpot. 
	
    `student@controller (chester) :~$` `printenv | grep OS_`
	
    <pre>
    OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=default
    OS_IMAGE_API_VERSION=2
    OS_PROJECT_NAME=vault_tek
    OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3
    OS_PASSWORD=fa5tpa55w0rd
    OS_AUTH_URL=http://controller:5000/v3
    OS_USERNAME=chestercopperpot
    OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME=default
    </pre>

0. Note the CLI changed. Run commands and see how the results differ from Chester's perspective. First retrive the list of flavors. This command will work, as Chester has permissions to list flavors.

    `student@controller (chester) :~$` `openstack flavor list`
	
0. Now retrieve a list of users. This command will not work, as Chester does not have permissions to see the users (admin would have permissions to issue this command).

    `student@controller (chester) :~$` `openstack user list`
    
    > This should result in an HTTP 403 failure. The user Chester does not have an admin role, and user list requires admin level permissions.

0. Let's repeat the process for the user aliceanderson

    `student@controller (chester) :~$` `vim alice.rc`  
	
0. Edit **alice.rc** so it looks like the following (copy and paste is fine):

    <pre>
    export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME=default
    export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=default
    export OS_PROJECT_NAME=acme_inc
    export OS_USERNAME=aliceanderson
    export OS_PASSWORD=fa5tpa55w0rd
    export OS_AUTH_URL=http://controller:5000/v3
    export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3
    export OS_IMAGE_API_VERSION=2
    export PS1="\[\e[33m\]\u\[\e[m\]@\[\e[36m\]\h\[\e[m\] (\[\e[35m\]alice\[\e[m\]) :\W\$ "
    </pre>
	
	> **Vim hints:**  
         To start editing changes, do the following:  
	 press i (to enter --INSERT-- mode)  
	 Top stop editing, do the following:
	 To move cursor around:
	 Use up, down, left, right arrows on the keyboard
	 press ESC (to enter command mode)
	 To save and quit, do the following:

	 press press q! (to quit), and press ENTER to confirm.
	
0. Display the contents of **alice.rc** and verify that they are correct

    `student@controller (chester) :~$` `cat alice.rc`
	
0. Finally, let's repeat the process again for user bobbarker

    `student@controller (chester) :~$` `vim bob.rc`  
	
0. Edit **bob.rc** so it looks like the following (copy and paste is fine):

    <pre>
    export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME=default
    export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=default
    export OS_PROJECT_NAME=acme_inc
    export OS_USERNAME=bobbarker
    export OS_PASSWORD=fa5tpa55w0rd
    export OS_AUTH_URL=http://controller:5000/v3

0. Display the contents of **bob.rc** and verify that they are correct

    `student@controller (chester) :~$` `cat bob.rc`

0. You can actually use the Horizon Dashboard to assist in creating an RC file for a user. Start by logging into the Horizon dashboard as **`default:chestercopperpot:fa5tpa55w0rd`**

0. Click on **Project > Compute > Access & Security**

0. Click on the tab **API Access**

0. In the upper right corner, click on the button **Download OpenStack RC File v3**

	![Download OpenStack RC File v3](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_horizon_api_download_rc_file.png)

0. This file will download to the Firefox download folder on the remote desktop. **This file is just for your own reference**, but you should know that is is possible for Horizon to manufacture an RC file for a specific user.

0. The file you open will look similar to the one shown below. 
    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    # To use an OpenStack cloud you need to authenticate against the Identity
    # service named keystone, which returns a **Token** and **Service Catalog**.
    # The catalog contains the endpoints for all services the user/tenant has
    # access to - such as Compute, Image Service, Identity, Object Storage, Block
    # Storage, and Networking (code-named nova, glance, keystone, swift,
    # cinder, and neutron).
    #
    # *NOTE*: Using the 3 *Identity API* does not necessarily mean any other
    # OpenStack API is version 3. For example, your cloud provider may implement
    # Image API v1.1, Block Storage API v2, and Compute API v2.0. OS_AUTH_URL is
    # only for the Identity API served through keystone.
    export OS_AUTH_URL=http://controller:5000/v3

    # With the addition of Keystone we have standardized on the term **project**
    # as the entity that owns the resources.
    export OS_PROJECT_ID=6417af4dea224c5999e89a7634d27645
    export OS_PROJECT_NAME="vault_tek"
    export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME="default"
    if [ -z "$OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME" ]; then unset OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME; fi

    # unset v2.0 items in case set
    unset OS_TENANT_ID
    unset OS_TENANT_NAME

    # In addition to the owning entity (tenant), OpenStack stores the entity
    # performing the action as the **user**.
    export OS_USERNAME="chestercopperpot"

    # With Keystone you pass the keystone password.
    echo "Please enter your OpenStack Password: "
    read -sr OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
    export OS_PASSWORD=$OS_PASSWORD_INPUT

    # If your configuration has multiple regions, we set that information here.
    # OS_REGION_NAME is optional and only valid in certain environments.
    export OS_REGION_NAME="RegionOne"
    # Don't leave a blank variable, unset it if it was empty
    if [ -z "$OS_REGION_NAME" ]; then unset OS_REGION_NAME; fi

    This file is a bit fancier than the previous one we studied, but it is well commented. There are two key differences between this file and ours:
    >
    1) The first is that this file will require the user to enter their password instead of storing it locally as plain-text. In production, this is desirable, as asking users to enter their password will prevent admins from having to manage security and permissions on user files because they contain plain-text passwords.
    >
    2) The second difference is that this file also sets some additional environmental variables, which could be problematic, as our other .\*rc files do NOT set these variables. If we source back to another user without first unsetting these variables, we might get ourselves into trouble. So instead of using this file, let's just borrow the piece of code that asks the user for the password. It is shown below for reference:

    ```
    # With Keystone you pass the keystone password. 
    echo "Please enter your OpenStack Password: "
    read -sr OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
    export OS_PASSWORD=$OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
    ```
    
0. We're done in Horizon for now. Return to your SSH session with the controller and source admin.rc

    `student@controller (chester) :~$` `source admin.rc`

0. Let's create a new user (Doris Day) within the vault_tek project (tenant) and then create a source file that prompts for a password.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack user create --domain default --project vault_tek --password fa5tpa55w0rd --email doris@day.com dorisday`
    
    ```

    ```

0. Apply a role to the new user

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack role add --user dorisday --project vault_tek user`

0. Create a file we can source for Doris Day of Vault Tek.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `vim doris.rc`

0. Edit `doris.rc` so it looks like the following (you can copy and paste the text below into *doris.rc*):

    ```
    export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME=default
    export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=default
    export OS_PROJECT_NAME=vault_tek
    export OS_USERNAME=dorisday
    echo "Please enter your OpenStack Password: "
    read -sr OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
    export OS_PASSWORD=$OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
    export OS_AUTH_URL=http://controller:5000/v3
    export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3
    export OS_IMAGE_API_VERSION=2
    export PS1="\[\e[33m\]\u\[\e[m\]@\[\e[36m\]\h\[\e[m\] (\[\e[35m\]doris\[\e[m\]) :\W\$ "

    `Please enter your OpenStack Password:` `fa5tpa55w0rd`

0. Answer the following questions

    - **Q1: Is this mechanism, prompting for a password, more secure? Why or why not?**
      - A1: In theory, yes. A user being prompted for a password is more secure than letting a password sit in a plain text document where proper read permissions and encryption may or may not be applied. Regardless, anytime the **export** command is used to set an environmental variable in a linux shell, securing that shell session should be a primary concern. 
	
0. Make sure the file works. Test by issuing a CLI command requiring authentication.

0. Great. So one last thing. In the past, some students have been 'concerned' when their prompts don't look 'like normal'. You should understand that the environmental variable PS1 controls how the command prompt 'looks'. Just for fun, let's tweak it to something silly. Issue the following command:
	
    `student@controller (doris) :~$` `export PS1="Leroy Jenkins: "`

0. You command prompt changed. So you COULD close the terminal session, and start a new one. This will clear any set environmental variables. Alternatively, just run a little custom script that Alta3 put together for you, /home/student/**unset.rc**. Feel free to run unset.rc anytime you'd like to clear out environmental variables related to OpenStack.

    `Leroy Jenkins: ` `source unset.rc`

0. The command prompt should return to "normal". 

    `student@controller:~$`
    
0. Great job! That's it for this lab.
