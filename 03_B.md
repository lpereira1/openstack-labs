### Lab XY - User Roles and Permissions - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to introduce the concept of controlling OpenStack user permissions with ‘roles’.

Before we get started, let's review some key terms:

   - **Projects** - Organizational units in the cloud to which you can assign users. Projects are also known as tenants or accounts.
   - **Users** - This is what a single user would sign into Horizon with. Users are members of one or more projects.
   - **Roles** - define which actions users can perform. You assign roles to user-project pairs.

OpenStack uses a Role Based Access Control (RBAC) mechanism to manage accesses to resources. Users' roles granted on each project and domain are stored into Keystone, and can be updated through Keystone's API. However, policy enforcement (actually allowing or not the access to resources according to a user's roles) is performed independently in each service, based on the rules defined in each policy.json file.

You assign roles to user-project pairs. Define actions for OpenStack service roles in the /etc/**project**/policy.json files. For example, define actions for Compute service roles in the /etc/**nova**/policy.json file.

### Procedure

0. First let us find all of the policy.json files on the system.

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `find / -name 'policy.json' 2>&1 | grep -v "Permission denied"`

    > Note that there is a policy for nova, keystone, cinder, glance, neutron, and ceilometer
	
	```
	/etc/heat/policy.json
	/etc/keystone/policy.json
	/etc/glance/policy.json
	/etc/nova/policy.json
	/etc/neutron/policy.json
	/etc/cinder/policy.json
        ```

0. Great! Now let's take a look at what one of these files contains.

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `sudo cat /etc/cinder/policy.json | less`
	
    > For students who do not have much experience using the less command:
    - **Press q to quit -** Exit Less utility and return to the CLI
    - **Press CTRL + F -** Forward one window
    - **Press CTRL + B -** Back one window
    - Less utility cheat sheet (http://sheet.shiar.nl/less)

	> The rules contained inside of these files may be customized. Customizing these rules controls who may call on a particular service. 
	> For example, maybe you want to create a user that may ONLY create a virtual router with neutron, or ONLY create cinder volumes. 
	> This is all made possible with roles.

	>  Each policy is defined by a one-line statement in the form "<target>" : "<rule>".

	> If you want to go on a deep dive concerning defining roles within policy.json, check out the following link: http://docs.openstack.org/kilo/config-reference/content/policy-json-file.html

	>  Here are a few basic examples of syntax usage within policy.json:

	> `"volume:get": "",` Means anyone can do a "volume:get": "", that is to say, this empty string means 'always'.

	> `"volume:get": "rule:admin_api",` Means that ONLY admin_api can "volume:get"

	> `"volume:get": "!",` Means NO ONE EVER can "volume:get"

0. To view the current roles available, type the following:

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `openstack role list`

	> There are two roles you should know about:
	
    > The `_member_` role, when assigned to a user, allows a user to manage all of the resources within their project (instances, volumes, and so on). If no role is defined, than this default role will be applied.

    > The `admin` role, when assigned to a user, allows the user total control over the entire OpenStack platform.

0. Let's give alice the role ultra_admin, so start by obtaining acme_inc's ID

	`[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `openstack project list`
	
    ```	
    +----------------------------------+---------------+
    | ID                               | Name          |

    +----------------------------------+---------------+
    ```

0. Now assign alice the role of ultra-admin of tenant acme_inc
    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#`  `openstack role add --user aliceanderson --project <INSERT acme_inc id here> ultra_admin`

    > There will be no special output reward if you get this right

0. To confirm that aliceanderson is now a 'ultra_admin'

	`[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `openstack role assignment list --user aliceanderson`

    ```	
    +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+-------+----------------------------------+--------+-----------+

    +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+-------+----------------------------------+--------+-----------+

    ```

0. Humans aren't great with working with UUIDs, but that is what Openstack wants us to use. Lets augment our last command to make it more 'human' friendly.

	`[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `openstack role assignment list --user aliceanderson --names`

   ```	
   +-------------+-----------------------+-------+------------------+--------+-----------+
   | Role        | User                  | Group | Project          | Domain | Inherited |
   +-------------+-----------------------+-------+------------------+--------+-----------+
   | ultra_admin | aliceanderson@default |       | acme_inc@default |        | False     |
   | user        | aliceanderson@default |       | acme_inc@default |        | False     |
   +-------------+-----------------------+-------+------------------+--------+-----------+
   ```	
	
0. Of course, aliceanderson being an ultra_admin doesn't really do anything, until we edit the policy.json file so that the role ultra_admin performs the way we want it to, but hopefully roles are clear.

	* Now is a great time to ask the instructor to explain roles if you are still a bit unclear.

	* Manipulating these policy.json files is tricky, but the following link is a great resource with a cool working example if you're [looking to know more](http://www.florentflament.com/blog/customizing-openstack-rbac-policies.html)

#### 4. Creating a Project at the CLI (using python-openstackclient)

Earlier in this lab, there was mention of the python-openstackclient. The python-openstackclient is trying to unite all of the OpenStack services on a single platform with a common set of commands. Previously, commands were issued to clients customized to work with a single service (i.e. 'keystone user-create' or 'nova stop vm1' and so on...)

The following is a list of the steps you would take to utilize the python-openstackclient in order to create the project 'the_shire', as well as the user 'gandalf'.

1. SSH into your controller as root (if you are not already)

2. If you are not sourced as admin already, issue the following command:
	
	`[root@controller]#` `source keystonerc_admin`

3. Start the python-openstackclient
	
    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `openstack`

	> Within the python-openstackclient, you'll be issuing commands as admin since the admin permissions were set when you executed `openstack`

4. Get a sense of the commands you can issue:

	`(openstack)` `help`
	
	```

5. Issue the following commands to create the project, and then create the user `gandalf` with the password `noneshallpass`

    `(openstack)` `project create the_shire`

    `(openstack)` `user create gandalf --project the_shire --password noneshallpass --email gandalf@theshire.example`
	
	`(openstack)` `exit`

6. Log in to the Horizon interface as `gandalf` // `noneshallpass`

 * If you have forgotten how to get to Horizon, simply navigate to your FQDN in a web browser
 
 * The login should work! If it did, good job! If other students are still working, feel free to play around in the python-openstackclient a bit more.
