### MONDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to learn how to gain access to Horizon, and explore the interface as an admin user. In later labs, we can role play and start to add customers to our cloud, but for now we'll focus on how the interface works.

### Procedure

0. To get started, open the Firefox browser within your remote desktop environment, and connect to (`http://controller/horizon`). **Sign into the OpenStack web GUI** with the creds

Domain: **default**
User Name: **admin**
Password: **alta3**

    ![Login](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_02_a_horizon_signin.png)

0. Now, **click on Project > Compute > Overview**

    ![overview](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_02_a_overview.png)
  
0. In the upper right part of the screen is the user you are currently logged in as. In the upper left side of the screen is the domain (default) and project (admin) you are currently working within. Look at the screenshot below. The domain / project drop down menu, and the user drop down menu, have both been clearly defined. Take a moment to explore these.

0. On the left hand side screen **click on Identity > Projects**

    > In OpenStack, users are added to projects by a domain admin. Projects and tenants are interchangeable terms, used to refer to a group of resources and services. These resources and services might be used to create some kind of virtual infrastructure (think create a virtual machine). The amount of resources that might be consumed by a project is limited by a quota (defined by the admin). The user admin has their own project, also called admin. Think of the admin project as a location to host virtualized services that are integrated into the OpenStack deployment.

0. To start, let's edit the project we are already a part of, On the Projects screen, in the Name column **click on the blue admin link**

    ![admin link](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_02_a_blue_admin_link.png)

0. You should now be on the 'Project Details: admin' page. In the drop down menu, called "manage memebers", **select 'Edit Project'**.

    ![edit admin project](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_02_a_project_details.png)

0. In the Edit Project box that pops up, click on the **Quota tab**

0. **Change Instances from its current value**. How about 12? Change the value of Instances to read, Instances: 12

    ![change instances](https://alta3.com/static/images/alta3_lab_02_a_instances_values.png)

0. After you've made this change, **click the 'Save' button at the bottom of the screen.**

0. **Navigate to Project > Compute > Overview**

0. Examine the pie charts for Instances. It should now read **Used 0 of 12**, the total reflecting the quota our project has been given.

0. To view actual available system resources, **click on Admin > System > Hypervisors**.

    > Although this is noted in lecture, you might want to take a moment and read about an ongoing bug with the way VCPU is being presented in Horizon https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/+bug/1202965. Understand that this bug is marked low priority, as in a production system, it is unlikely these pie charts within the Horizon project would be the primary mechanism for monitoring resource utilization within the cloud.

0. One of the take aways from this lab, in addition to learning to explore the Horizon interface, is that projects have associated maximum thresholds that are defined by the project's quotas. Quotas are a glass ceiling, and not the actual resource capacity of the total cloud system.
