## Lab 25_A - Working with Neutron Networking in Horizon - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### WEDNESDAY

### Lab Objective

The Neutron service can not be well controlled from the OpenStack Horizon dashboard. However, visually minded individuals may find it helpful to use the Horizon dashboard to examine current network configuration as it does produce very clear illustrations of current network configuration. At the conclusion of this lab, students should feel comfortable creating and modifying network settings with the Horizon dashboard.

### Procedure

0. Use Firefox within your remote desktop to log into Horizon (http://controller/horizon) as **:default:aliceanderson:fa5tpa55w0rd:**

0. Navigate to **Project > Network > Network Topology** and click **"+ create network"**

    ![Create Network](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_lab_horizon_create_network.png)

0. Fill out the pop up box with the following information (you should be on the Network tab):

    ```
    NetworkName: acme-inc-network
    AdminState: UP
    [ ] Shared (unchecked)
    [x] Create Subnet
    ```

    ![Create Network Popup](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_lab_horizon_create_network_popup.png)


0. Click on the blue **Next** button, fill out that screen (the Subnet tab) with the following information:

    ```
    SubnetName: acme-inc-network-subnet-10
    Network Address: 10.10.0.0/24
    IPVersion: IPv4
    GatewayIP: 10.10.0.1
    [ ] Disable Gateway (unchecked)
    ```
	
    ![Create Network Popup_2](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_lab_horizon_create_network_popup_2.png)
	
0. All of the defaults are fine on this screen. So just hit the blue **Create** button in the bottom right corner.

0. The Network Topology screen you are on should change to reflect the creation of this new network. Try left clicking the little cloud icon that showed up on the screen.

0. Now click the **"Create Router" button** in the upper right corner.

    ![Create Router](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_lab_horizon_create_router.png)

0. Fill out pop up box with the following information: 

    ```
    Router Name: acme-inc-router
    Admin State: UP
    External Network: provider-net
    ```
    
    ![Create Router Popup](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_lab_horizon_create_router_popup.png)

0. The Network Topology page should now display the new router connected to the network public.

0. All that is left is to connect this router to the acme-inc-network. Start by navigating to **Project > Network > Routers**

    ![Click Acme Inc Router Nav](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_lab_horizon_router_nav.png)

0. Click on the router named **acme-inc-router**

    ![Click Acme Inc Router](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_lab_horizon_acme_inc_router.png)

0. Now click on the tab labeled **"Interfaces"**. It's a bit hidden, so check the screenshot below.

    ![Click Acme Inc Interfaces](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_lab_horizon_interfaces_tab.png)

0. Finally click on the button **"+ Add Interface"** in the upper right corner.

0. Fill out the pop up box with the following information:

    ```
    Subnet: acme-inc-network: 10.10.0.0/24
    IPAddress: 10.10.0.1
    Router Name: acme-inc-router 
    RouterID: (default UUID)
    ```

    ![Click Acme Inc Router](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_lab_horizon_add_interface_popup.png)

0. Finally, navigate back to **Project > Network > Network Topology**. The Network Topology screen should appear like the screenshot below:

    ![Topology](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_lab_horizon_network_topo_final.png)

0. The user chestercopperpot is part of a different project (vault_tek), he should not be able to see the newly created network (acme_inc_network). Let's confirm this...

0. Log out of the OpenStack Horizon dashboard, and log back in as **:default:chestercopperpot:fa5tpa55w0rd:**

0. Navigate to **Project > Network > Network Topology**

    >
    The user chestercopperpot should not see the newly created acme_inc_network, as it was made in the acme_inc project, not the vault_tek project, to which chestercopperpot belongs.

0. Good job! That's it for this lab.
