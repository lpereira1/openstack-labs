## Lab 20 - Launching Instances from the CLI - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### TUESDAY

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to learn to how to launch instances from the CLI. This is a critical lab to understand, so don't hesitate to repeat it.

### Procedure

0. SSH to your controller as student.

    `student@beachhead:~#` `ssh controller`

0. Source the chester.rc file to issue commands as chestercopperpot

    `student@controller:~#` `source chester.rc`

0. Let's try launching some instances from the CLI. See what flavors are available for use to chestercopperpot.

    `student@controller (chester) :~#` `openstack flavor list`
    
0. See what images are available for use. Remeber that the image is the bootable portion. 

    `student@controller (chester) :~#` `openstack image list`
    
0. See what networks are available for use to attach the new VM to.

    `student@controller (chester) :~#` `neutron net-list`

    ```
    +--------------------------------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
    | id                                   | name         | subnets                                              |
    +--------------------------------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
    | b950cd8d-56ae-48f5-a2b6-c13a280f8dfc | provider-net | 330b9b42-5b8f-4aac-963a-0390f0acabfd 172.16.2.0/24   |
    +--------------------------------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
    ```
    
0. We have not studied networking yet. Normally, we would first create a virtual network, then launch that instance on that private network. We can study that later, for now, copy the UUID assocaited with the provider-net (it was revealed with the command **neutron net-list**).
 
0. Boot an instance called vt1 with the flavor custom.shrimpy, from the image cirros, and place it on the fabric network (more on networking is coming up)

	>
	NOTE: Instances typically will be placed on their own tenant network, and include a 'security group' (a set of IP rules); things we haven't yet studied (we'll get there in subsequent labs). Launching an instance without defining a security group, will result in using the 'default' security group, which denies all incoming traffic.

    `student@controller (chester) :~#` `openstack server create --flavor custom.shrimpy --image cirros --nic net-id=<xxxxxxxxxxxx> vt1`
 
    > where `<xxxxxxxxx>` = the internal private_network_id that you cut and paste from the above command `neutron net-list`

    ```

 * Of course your output will be unique from what is listed above. Use your output to answer the following questions:
 * What is the task state?
 * What ID was this instance assigned?
 * What tenant does this instance belong to?
 * What name was this instance given?
 * What image was used to boot this instance? 
 
0. Display a list of the running instances within the current tenant

    `student@controller (chester) :~#` `openstack server list`
    
 * What is the status?
 * What is the power state?
 * Hint: Issue the command again in a few minutes if they do not say "ACTIVE" and "Running" respectively.

0. Display information only about the running instance vt1 that was just created:

    `student@controller (chester) :~#` `openstack server show vt1`

0. Log into the Horizon dashboard interface as **`default:chestercopperpot:fa5tpa55w0rd`**

0. Navigate to **Project > Compute > Instances**

0. Click on the instance name (vt1). See the screen shot below if you're lost.

	![Navigate to VM](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_lab_horizon_click_vm.png)

0. Click on the log tab. Spend some time examining the log.

	![Navigate to VM](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3_lab_horizon_click_vm_log.png)

0. Click on the console tab. Try putting the VM in full screen mode, or hitting the /<ENTER/> key a few times to wake up the VM, but you should be able to log in to the Cirros VM with the following credentials **cirros:cubswin:)**
	
0. That's it for this lab! We'll continue to explore manipulating instances, but feel free to exploring launching instances from the CLI or Horizon, or checking out other OpenStack commands.
