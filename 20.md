### TUESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to teach basic administration of instances within the OpenStack cloud. Instances all have different 'states', and it is important to understand what those might be, and when it may be appropriate for an admin to force a customer instance into a different state. This lab has you select an instance from a project (which admin may or may not be a part of), and manipulate it as the OpenStack admin. If you finish this lab early, back through it again with an instance from a different project (tenant), or practice any admin skills involving instances ( diagnostic details / start / stop / suspend / pause / reboot / rescue).

### Procedure
 
0. Let's start fresh! Close any old terminal windows you have open, and then open a new one. Once you have a new terminal window open, SSH to controller. 

    `student@beachhead:/$` `ssh controller`

0. Source the admin.rc file.

    `student@controller:~$`  `source admin.rc`
 
0. First look at all of the instances in the on the OpenStack cloud. Note that the command we are about to issue will not tell us any details about the instances that are running (what compute node is hosting the instance, the flavor it is running, the image being utilized, and so on). Type the following command:

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack server list --all`

    ```
    +--------------------------------------+----------+---------+-----------------------+
    | ID                                   | Name     | Status  | Networks              |
    +--------------------------------------+----------+---------+-----------------------+
    | a06d7547-d380-44e6-9be8-650240faada0 | vt1      | ACTIVE  | demo-net=192.168.30.3 |
    +--------------------------------------+----------+---------+-----------------------+
    ```

 * Your output might differ, after all this table is a reflection of what instances you have created. In the last lab, we all created an instance (vt1), so we should all see it ACTIVE and Running.

0. You just issued a nova list command. The table displayed has several columns, these are: ID, Name, Tenant ID, Status, Task State, Power State, (and) Networks. Openstack works best when you reference UUIDs, NOT the human label names. The UUID that represents the VM (vt1) is diplayed in the column labeled, ID. So, we want to work with that UUID, but we don't want to keep typing that long UUID value! This problem can be solved by issuing the following command, which will set this value to shell variable called VAR_UUID.
 
 * We'll adhere to the convention of keeping all caps for the variable name (VAR_UUID), and set it to a simple string.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `VAR_UUID=zzzzzzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzzzzzz`  <- customize zzz... for the UUID of vt1

0. If you set the UUID correctly, you should see details of vt1 when you issue the following command. 

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack server show $VAR_UUID`

    ```

 * The answers to the following quetsions (A-F), are labeled (A-F) in the screenshot above.
 * A. What time was this instance created?
 * B. What flavor is being utilized?
 * C. Is the machine powered on, or powered off?
 * D. Which compute node is hosting this instance?
 * E. What is the IP address of this instance?
 * F. To what project does this instance belong?
 * Hint: Having trouble figuring out the tenant to which this instance belongs? Here's what to do, locate the value for 'tenant_id', it is a long UUID value. Issue **openstack project list** for a list of all the project IDs.

    ```
	
0. Sometimes administrators need to troubleshoot issues with an instance. An admin can retrieve diagnostic information about an instance with the following command

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `nova diagnostics $VAR_UUID`

0. Answer the following questions about the output from nova diagnostics:

 * (CPU details) What is the CPU time (in nano seconds)?
 * (Memory details) What is the max amount of memory (in MB)?
 * (Memory details) What is the actual amount of memory currently being used?
 * (Network details) How many octets have been received?
 * (Network details) How many octets have been dropped?
 * (Network details) How many packets have been transmitted?
 * (Disk details) How many disk reads have their been (in bytes)?
 * (Disk details) How many disk write requests have their been?

0. **Stop** the instance (vt1)

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack server stop $VAR_UUID`

0. Check to see if the instance (vt1) is really stopped

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack server show $VAR_UUID`
	
0. **Start** the instance (vt1). Note that admin may or may not be part of this project, and is still able to manipulate this instance.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack server start $VAR_UUID`

0. Is the instance running? Find out by using the nova show command

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack server show $VAR_UUID`
 
0. Now we'll pause and unpause a running instance. Pausing an instance stores the instance in memory (RAM), so in laptop terms, think of it as putting the instance into "sleep" mode. Try pausing the instance.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack server pause $VAR_UUID`

0. Use the CLI to confirm that the instance is paused

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack server show $VAR_UUID`
	
0. Use the browser to confirm that the instance is paused. Log into the Horizon OpenStack dashboard as **`default:admin:alta3`** and confirm that the instance is indeed paused.

    >
    Note that we just signed into Horizon as Chester, but manipulating his VM (vt1) as admin at the CLI.

0. Try unpausing the instance
	
    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack server unpause $VAR_UUID`

0. Use the CLI to confirm that the instance is ACTIVE

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack server show $VAR_UUID`

0. Once again, use the Horizon OpenStack dashboard as **`default:admin:alta3`** to confirm that the instance is Running.


0. Now let's try to suspend and resume a running instance. Suspending an instance stores the instance on the disk, so in laptop terms, think of it as putting the instance into "hibernation" mode. Try suspending the instance.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack server suspend $VAR_UUID`
	
0. Use the CLI to confirm that the instance is suspended

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack server show $VAR_UUID`
	
0. Use the browser to confirm that the instance is suspended. Log into the Horizon OpenStack dashboard as **`default:admin:alta3`** and confirm that the instance is indeed suspended.

0. Try resuming the instance

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack server resume $VAR_UUID`
	
0. Use the CLI to confirm that the instance is resumed.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack server show $VAR_UUID`
	
0. Once again, use the Horizon OpenStack dashboard as **`default:admin:alta3`** to confirm that the instance is running.

0. Issue the following commands to reboot the instance and then view the status (this is a graceful shutdown, to perform a forceful shutdown, include --hard after the reboot command)

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack server reboot $VAR_UUID`

    > HURRY! You have less than 1 second to issue the next command...  
    > Just try again if you do not see the REBOOT status (No one ever gets this on the first try!) 
    > Most people issue the next command and it is already too late, so the status shows ACTIVE, therefore, use the up arrow key to reissue the `nova reboot $VAR_UUID` and the `nova show $VAR_UUID` back to back. The second try usually will give the results shown below.  Of course you could always try issuing both commands on the same line:  `nova reboot $VAR_UUID && nova show $VAR_UUID` but where is the challenge in that?  :)  

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack server show $VAR_UUID`

    > You will only have a moment to issue the `openstack server show $VAR_UUID` command, or the above screen will continue to show the VM as ACTIVE / running (it reboots VERY quickly!) If you don't catch it, no big deal, just study the above screenshot.
 
0. Sometimes a user/customer will lock themselves out of their machine, or perhaps they corrupt their file system. The result is that they are unable to access or start their instance. The solution, is to start the machine with nova rescue.
 * nova rescue will first gracefully shutdown the instance (after 60 seconds, it will perform a poweroff, to increase this value, edit nova.conf)
 * This command attaches a secondary bootdisk, so that the instance's volumes can be accessed through a Linux image (new login and password is expressed as Property and Value)
 * Think of this process as removing a HDD from a computer that doesn't work, jamming it in a rescue machine so that you can try to fix it (or maybe reset the password)

0. To put a instance in rescue mode, issue the following:

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack server rescue $VAR_UUID`

	```
	+-----------+--------------+
	| Property  | Value        |
	+-----------+--------------+
	| adminPass | BpZh5d475JZ6 |
	+-----------+--------------+
	```

     > When SSH-ing into the rescued image:  
	**Property** means login  
      **Value** is the password  
      Consider watching the instance in the dashboard and observe the change from normal to rescue behavior

0. Take note what is happening in the process of rescuing.  

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack server show $VAR_UUID`

0. Before we can stop vt1, it must first be taken out of rescue mode. Issue the following command:

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack server unrescue $VAR_UUID`
	
0. Confirm that the machine is once again active and running.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack server show $VAR_UUID`
    
0. Good job! That is it for this lab.
