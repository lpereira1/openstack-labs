### Lab Duration: 60 minutes

### Lab Objective 

The objective of this lab is to create a block storage volume with Cinder and then attach it to a VM instance. This is the virtual equivalent of plugging a new drive into a computer. Just like a physical drive, volumes can be attached, detached, reattached, and moved between VM instances.

#### Create a Cinder block storage volume using the CLI

0. We'll replicate the same steps at the CLI that we just performed in Horizon. If you get the idea, and not particularly strong at the CLI, it is alright to skip this section.

0. Issue the following command to take on permissions related to the user Chester Copperpot

    `ender@controller admin >` `source chester.rc`

0. Create a new volume called **NASferatu** a **1 Gb** in size/

    `ender@controller chester >` `openstack volume create --ize 1 NASferatu`

0. Based on the output, answer the following questions:

    - **Q1: Is this a bootable volume?**
      - A1: No. The value of bootable is false.
    - **Q2: Is this volume encrypted?**
      - Q2: No. The value of encrypted is false.
    - **Q3: What is the status?**
      - Q3: The status is listed as creating

0. Issue the following command to retrieve a list of cinder volumes available to the current users chestercopperpot:

    `ender@controller chester >` `openstack volume list`
	
    - **Q1: What is teh ID of NASferatu?**
      - A1: NASferatu is identified by an UUID revealed by the openstack volume list command
    - **Q2: Has the status changed?**
      - Q2: Yes. The status is now listed as available.

0. Issue the following command to retrive a list of the instances currently in operation. Note the ID of vt2.
	
    `ender@controller chester >` `openstack server list`
	
0. Issue the following command to attach the new volume (NASferatu) to a VM instance (vt2)
	
    `ender@controller chester >` `openstack server add volume <replace_with_ID_of_instance_vt2> <replace_with_ID_of_volume_NASferatu>`
	
0. Confirm that NASferatu has been Attached to vt2
	
    `ender@controller chester >` `openstack volume list`
	
0. Issue the following command to detach the volume from vt2

    `ender@controller chester >` `openstack server remove volume <replace_with_ID_of_instance_vt2> <replace_with_ID_of_volume_NASferatu>`
	
0. Check on the status of the volume (NASferatu)
	
    `ender@controller chester >` `openstack volume list`

    - **Q1: What is the status of NASferatu?**
      - A1: It has changed from in-use, to available.

0. Now that the volume is detached, delete it.
	
    `ender@controller chester >` `openstack volume delete <replace_with_ID_of_volume_NASferatu>`

0. Confirm that the volume has been deleted.

    `ender@controller chester >`  `openstack volume list`
	
    - **Q1: What is the status of NASferatu?**
      - A1: NASferatu has been deleted and is no longer available.

0. In the next section, you will SSH into vt2. You should have started it in Horizon, but take a moment and make sure vt2 is powered on (and not shutoff). You can see which VMs are powered up, or down, by using the **nova list** command. If needed, vt2 can be started with the **nova start vt2** command.
