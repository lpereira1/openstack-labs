## Lab 09 - Taking Control of a Project as admin - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### MONDAY

### Lab Objective

Now that Alice Anderson and Bob Barker have been added to the project space Acme Inc, let's sign in as the admin user and confirm that we can manipulate the instances (created infrastructure) in the acme_inc project.

### Procedure

0. From within your remote desktop environment, sign out of Horizon. If you already closed your Firefox browser containing your Horizon session, go ahead and start a new one by relaunching Firefox and then navigating to: http://controller/horizon

0. Log into Horizon as **default:admin:alta3**

0. **Navigate to Admin > System > Instances > Instance Name: acme_vm2 > Log Tab**

0. Study the log file and answer the following questions:
    - **Q1: What is the default username associated with this cirrOS image? (Look near the bottom of the log)**
      - A1: cirros
    - **Q2: What is the password associated with this user? (Look near the bottom of the log)**
      - A2: cubswin:)
    
0. **Click on Admin > System > Instances**

0. Check all the tick boxes beside the running instances. **Click  'Delete Instances'**. This will delete these machines (forever). If you need some help, check out the following screenshot. (After you click delete, you'll also need to confirm deletion of the instances).

0. Once more log out of Horizon, and log back in as **default:aliceanderson:fa5tpa55w0rd**

0. The acme_inc project should no longer have any running instances. To confirm, **click on Project > Compute > Overview**. The **Limit Summary** chart on this page should indicate that 0 instances are running.

0. **Click on Project > Compute > Instances**, and again confirm that no instances are shown.

0. To recap, the **admin** user deleted all VMs created by both **aliceanderson** and **bobbarker**; both users within the **acme_inc** project. You may be wondering why those users did not delete the virtual machines that they created. Indeed, that is normally how it is done. In this case, we just wanted to show you that admin has access to manipulate VMs across projects (tenant) spaces. In later labs, we'll explore other ways to manipulate VM states, such as: suspending, pausing, and rescuing.

0. Great job! That's it for this lab.
