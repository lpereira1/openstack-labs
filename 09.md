## Lab 09 - Taking Control of a Project as admin - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### MONDAY

### Lab Objective

Now that Alice Anderson and Bob Barker have been added to the project space Acme Inc, let's sign in as the admin user and confirm that we can manipulate the instances (created infastructure) in the acme_inc project.

### Procedure

0. From within your remote desktop environment, sign out of Horizon. If you already closed your Firefox browser containing your Horizon session, go ahead and start a new one by relaunching Firefox and then navigating to: http://controller/horizon

0. Log into Horizon as **default:admin:alta3**

0. **Navigate to Admin > System > Instances > Instance Name: acme_vm2 > Log Tab**

0. Study the log file and answer the following questions:
    - **Q1: What is the default username associated with this cirrOS image? (Look near the bottom of the log)**
      - A1: cirros
    - **Q2: What is the password associated with this user? (Look near the bottom of the log)**
      - A2: cubswin:)
    
0. **Click on Admin > System > Instances**

0. Check all the tick boxes beside the running instances. **Click  'Delete Instances'**. This will delete these machines (forever).

0. Once more log out of Horizon, and log back in as **default:aliceanderson:fa5tpa55w0rd**

0. The acme_inc project should no longer have any running instances. To confirm, **click on Project > Compute > Overview**. The **List Summary** charts on this page should indicate that 0 instances are running.

0. **Click on Project > Compute > Instances**, and again confirm that no instances are shown. 

0. That is it for this lab. To recap, the *admin* user deleted a machine created by *bobbarker*. You may be wondering why bobbarker did not delete the machine that he created; indeed, that is normally how it is done. In this case, we just wanted to show you thad admin has access to manipulate VMs across projects (tenant) spaces.
