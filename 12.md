## Lab 12 - User Roles and Permissions - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### MONDAY

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to introduce the concept of controlling OpenStack user permissions with ‘roles’.

Before we get started, let's review some key terms:

   - **Projects** - Organizational units in the cloud to which you can assign users. Projects are also known as tenants or accounts.
   - **Users** - This is what a single user would sign into Horizon with. Users are members of one or more projects.
   - **Roles** - define which actions users can perform. You assign roles to user-project pairs.

OpenStack uses a Role Based Access Control (RBAC) mechanism to manage accesses to resources. Users' roles granted on each project and domain are stored into Keystone, and can be updated through Keystone's API. However, policy enforcement (actually allowing or not the access to resources according to a user's roles) is performed independently in each service, based on the rules defined in each policy.json file.

You assign roles to user-project pairs. Permissions are defined for **OpenStack service roles** in the /etc/**\<project\>**/policy.json files. For example, actions are defined for **compute** service roles would be found in the /etc/**nova**/policy.json file.

### Procedure

0. If you have an old terminal session open, close it, and open a new one. Then type the following:

    `student@beachhead:/$` `ssh controller`

0. The CLI prompt should now read as follows:

    `student@controller:~$`

0. We're going to look at the controller system a bit. Therefore, it is **not** necessary to source admin.rc. Everything we're about to do is related to the underlying Linux OS. First identify all of the policy.json files on the controller.

    `student@controller:~$` `sudo find /etc -name 'policy.json' 2>&1 | grep -v "Permission denied"`

    > Note that there is a policy for heat, glance, aodh, keystone, neutron, ceilometer, cinder, and nova.
	
	```
/etc/heat/policy.json
/etc/glance/policy.json
/etc/aodh/policy.json
/etc/keystone/policy.json
/etc/neutron/policy.json
/etc/ceilometer/policy.json
/etc/cinder/policy.json
/etc/nova/policy.json
	```

0. Great! Now let's take a look at what one of these files contains.

    `student@controller:~$` `cat /etc/cinder/policy.json | less`
	
    > For students who do not have much experience using the less command:
    - **Press q to quit -** Exit Less utility and return to the CLI
    - **Press CTRL + F -** Forward one window
    - **Press CTRL + B -** Back one window
    - Less utility cheat sheet (http://sheet.shiar.nl/less)

	> The rules contained inside of these files may be customized. Customizing these rules controls who may call on a particular service. 
	> For example, maybe you want to create a user that may ONLY create a virtual router with neutron, or ONLY create cinder volumes. 
	> This is all made possible with roles.

	>  Each policy is defined by a one-line statement in the form "<target>" : "<rule>".

	> If you want to go on a deep dive concerning defining roles within policy.json, check out the following link: http://docs.openstack.org/kilo/config-reference/content/policy-json-file.html

	>  Here are a few basic examples of syntax usage within policy.json:

	> `"volume:get": "",` Means anyone can do a "volume:get": "", that is to say, this empty string means 'always'.

	> `"volume:get": "rule:admin_api",` Means that ONLY admin_api can "volume:get"

	> `"volume:get": "!",` Means NO ONE EVER can "volume:get"

0. When you are done checking out /etc/cinder/policy.json, press **q** to exit the less utility.

0. We want to view the current roles defined in Keystone. This will require issuing OpenStack commands, so time to **source admin.rc**.

    `student@controller:~$` `source admin.rc`

0. Now that we have exported environmental variables that define us as an OpenStack admin, we went to view the current roles available. Type the following:

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack role list`

	> What is displayed is default roles. You can create more, or define these differently, but here's what you should know:
	
	> By default, the `user` role, when assigned to a user, allows a user to manage all of the resources within their project (instances, volumes, and so on). If no role is defined, than this default role will be applied.
	
	> By default, when the `admin` role is assigned to a user, that user has unlimited permissions within an Openstack domain.

	> By default, the `heat_stack_owner` role must be assigned to a user that manages stacks.

	> By default, the `heat_stack_user` role is assigned to any users created by Orchestration (Heat) during deployment and is highly restricted.

0. Create a new role called `restricted_user` by typing the following:

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack role create restricted_user`

    > Roles are applied when the user is created, and may also be applied after the user is created.
    
    > Users may occupy more than one role

    | name      | restricted_user                  |
    +-----------+----------------------------------+
    ```
0. Create a new user, **edgar** in the project acme_inc

    `student@controller (admin) :~$`  `openstack user create --project acme_inc --password fa5tpa55w0rd --email edgar@example.com --domain default edgar`

0. Give edgar the role of **restricted_user**

    `student@controller (admin) :~$`  `openstack role add --user edgar --project acme_inc restricted_user`

0. There isn't any special reward for adding a role, so check your work with the following command.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$`  `openstack role assignment list --user edgar`

0. The table displayed contains UUIDs, which aren't intelligible by humans. So run that command again, only this time with the **--names** command-argument.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$`  `openstack role assignment list --user edgar --names`

    ```
    +-----------------+---------------+-------+------------------+--------+-----------+
    | Role            | User          | Group | Project          | Domain | Inherited |
    +-----------------+---------------+-------+------------------+--------+-----------+
    | restricted_user | edgar@default |       | acme_inc@default |        | False     |
    +-----------------+---------------+-------+------------------+--------+-----------+
    ```
    
0. Of course, edgar being **restricted_user** won't allow him to do **anything**, until we edit any of the /etc/\<service\>/policy.json files so that the role restricted_user is defined as being allowed to perform some actions. We won't actually do this, but hopefully how roles work are clear. If that isn't the case, now is a great time to ask the instructor to explain roles a bit further.

0. Good job! That is it for this lab. Manipulating these policy.json files is tricky, but the following link is a great resource with a cool working example if you're [looking to know more](http://www.florentflament.com/blog/customizing-openstack-rbac-policies.html)
