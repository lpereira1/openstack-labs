## Lab XY - Exploring Horizon - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### MONDAY

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to learn how to gain access to Horizon, and explore the interface as an admin user. In later labs, we can role play and start to add customers to our cloud, but for now we'll focus on how the interface works.

### Procedure

0. To get started, open the Firefox browser within your remote desktop environment, and connect to (`http://controller/horizon`). **Sign into the OpenStack web GUI** with the creds **default:admin:askinstructor**

0. Before we get started, **click on Project > Compute > Overview**

    > One more thing we can take note of: in the upper right part of the screen is the user you are currently logged in as. In the upper left side of the screen is the project you are currently working within. Look at the screenshot below. The project drop down menu and user drop down menu have both been clearly defined with large red arrows.

0. On the left hand side screen **click on Identity > Projects** The projects below in the red outline are ones you will soon add. They will not appear yet on your screen. Right now, all you should see are the tenants outlined in green below.

    >  Note: In OpenStack, users belong to Projects. Projects and tenants are interchangeable terms, used to refer to a group of users, and the total amount of cloud resources those users may consume (for, say, switching on instances). When OpenStack was new, compute had its own authentication mechanism and used the term 'project'. Authorization is now handled by the Keystone service, where it uses the word 'tenant'.
    > The admin tenant has their own default project.  This can be useful location to host virtualized services that are integrated into the OpenStack deployment.

0. To start, let's edit the project we are already a part of, On the Projects screen, in the Name column **click on the blue admin link**

0. You should now be on the 'Project Details: admin' page. In the drop down menu in the upper right, **select 'Edit Project'**.

0. In the Edit Project box that pops up, click on the **Quota tab**

0. **Change VCPUs from its current value**, to something absurd. After all, we're just trying to drive home a point. How about 2 million? Change the value of VCPU to read, VCPU: 2000000

0. Change Instances from its current value, to 1 million. **Change the value of instances to read, Instances: 1000000**

0. After you've made those two changes, **click the 'Save' button at the bottom of the screen.**

0. **Navigate to Project > Compute > Overview**

    > Examine the pie charts for Instances, and VCPUs. They've changed radically, but only to reflect the quota our project has been given. Hopefully it is clear that we couldn't possibly have just increased the resource capacity of our system by a factor of 100 million by simply changing the value of a variable.

0. To view actual available system resources, **click on Admin > System > Hypervisors**. You're welcome to go there now, but we'll devote another lab to exploring this section later. So for now, don't get too caught up in it.

    > What we want to take away from this section is that projects have associated maximum thresholds that are defined by the project's quotas. Quotas may exceed the actual resource capacity of the total cloud system, therefore the size of a project may be limited by the quota, or resource capacity of the system itself.
